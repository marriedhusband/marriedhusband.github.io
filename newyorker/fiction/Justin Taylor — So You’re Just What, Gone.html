<p class="descender" word_count="164"> It’s one of those airlines where you get your seat assignment at the gate, and they’re late to Logan and slow to get through security, so the lady at the counter can’t seat Charity and her mom together. Which means five-plus hours of freedom—hallelujah! Nonetheless, she pouts about having to sit with a <em>total stranger</em>, all because her mom was a spaz about the body scanner and they had to wait while a female agent was summoned to conduct a pat-down. Charity went through the scanner without protest, hands up like a criminal—it was kind of fun—standing in her sock feet in the chamber. She hustled out, in order to catch a glimpse of the agent’s screen, hoping to see her own skeleton, though she knew it wouldn’t be there. This wasn’t like X-rays at the doctor. What she saw was herself simplified to an outline: an empty female shape imposed over a green-gray field.</p>
<p word_count="97">“There’s more radiation in our phones, I bet,” Charity says, still not quite ready to let the issue drop. She doesn’t want to go to Seattle and visit Grams. Missing a week of school is cool, in theory, but her A.P. English teacher has assigned her a stupid compare-and-contrast about “A Tale of Two Cities,” to make up for the classes she’ll miss. Between that and a sheaf of Algebra 2 worksheets, she doesn’t see how she’s coming out ahead. She’s almost sixteen; why couldn’t she just have stayed home?</p>

<p word_count="53">Outside, men in orange vests and earmuffs and yellow knit gloves pull bags from the back of a flatbed trailer and chuck them into the guts of the plane. It’s drizzling, the dark tarmac streaky with reflections of pinkish guide lights. Six-thirty in the morning and they’ve been up since four.</p>
<div class="scPlayerContainer" data-sctrack="204421318"></div>
<p class="descender" word_count="43">Charity’s seat turns out to be twenty rows in front of her mom’s: another miracle. “Try to get some sleep, Sweetie,” her mom says, working a piece of Nicorette free from its blister pack as she kisses her daughter’s cheek.</p>
<p word_count="47">“I’m gonna do whatever I’m gonna do,” she says. Case in point: she was up till almost one last night, Gchatting with her best friend, Lexie, and messing around on YouTube, trading links to cheesy nineties music videos and gross-out clips from medical reality shows.</p>
<p word_count="96">Charity is stuck in the middle seat. The window seat is occupied by a fat woman wearing a gray sweatshirt that says “Hawaii” in knobby grapefruit-colored letters, her fingernails painted to match, which Charity can see clearly, because the woman’s hands are pressed together in front of her. Head bowed and lips moving in silent prayer. Charity sits down in the empty aisle seat and begins her own prayer—that nobody will come, even though they keep announcing over the thing that the flight is full, no upgrades available, check rolling bags at the gate.</p>
<p word_count="95">When the guy appears, he’s older, way older—like thirty, maybe. He wears leather sandals and a powder-blue slim-cut dress shirt, untucked and with the sleeves rolled. When he lifts his black backpack up into the overhead compartment, Charity finds herself staring straight into his exposed navel, a bulging outie like a blind gold eye in his belly, which was waxed at some point and is now stubbled, like a face. The top of his boxers peeks up above the waist of what Charity just so happens to recognize as three-hundred-dollar True Religion jeans.</p>
<p word_count="138">“Keeping my seat warm for me?” he says. She mumbles a few words, any one of which might be “Sorry,” and heaves herself and her satchel-purse and her water bottle over to where she belongs, only to realize—<em>idiot</em>—that she’s left her shoes under the guy’s seat and has to ask him to move so she can get them. He gives her a tight obliging smile and half-shifts his legs, kind of miming the concept of “getting out of the way” while still being in it. She has to reach between his ankles to grab her All Stars, which he could’ve just handed to her, though in fairness to him if the situation were reversed she wouldn’t touch his shoes for anything. Those grody sandals. Guh. He has hairy feet and narrow toes.</p>
<p word_count="60">She digs around in her bag and takes out “A Tale of Two Cities,” but she isn’t allowed to put the tray down yet and the book is heavy and the canned air is making her chilly. Ah, screw it. She’ll close her eyes through the boring stuff: flight safety, weather update, taxiing, and then the liftoff rush.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="59">Her eyes flutter open and she sees an attendant going around offering complimentary newspapers. Aisle Guy grabs a <em>Financial Times</em>. He frowns at it, then turns to Charity and grins at her, a dadlike grin, crinkles blossoming around his mouth and eyes. “What do you think the odds are of finding anything in here I care about?” he says.</p>

<p word_count="38">“What?” she says. “I don’t . . .” His eyes are a washed-out green. The world feels crude and unfocussed, a bad sketch of itself. And she was wrong a moment earlier: he does not look like anyone’s dad.</p>
<p word_count="99">“The future of the rupee,” he says, laughing—to himself? At her? “Interest rates. Taiwan.” But then, as abruptly as he’s engaged her, a headline in the paper catches his interest and he disappears behind the salmon curtain, leaving her alone with Fat Hawaii, who stinks of sweat and is studying <em>SkyMall</em> like it’s the lost fifth Gospel. “A Tale of Two Cities” is still splayed open in Charity’s lap. She shoves it into the seat-back pocket, half hoping she’ll forget it there. She reclines her seat its measly inch and closes her eyes again.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="150">She wakes some time later to sunlight on her face: Fat Hawaii’s window shade is up, and her vision is a sea of burnt orange, with swimmers of emerald and gold. At some point she must’ve slumped over—she can feel the armrest she shares with Aisle Guy digging into her ribs. He has his tray table down: empty Styrofoam cup, two crumpled pretzel bags, and a pile of documents, the pink newspaper beneath. He’s leafing through the documents with his left hand, so as not to disturb her, since she’s leaning on his right side. Her head, she’s coming to realize, is on his shoulder, like you’d do with a boyfriend or something. Her neck is cricked and her breast is squished against his bicep and she can feel his heat, can smell his cologne or soap or deodorant or whatever it is—</p>
<p word_count="4">Charity jolts herself upright.</p>
<p word_count="5">“Hey there, sleepyhead,” he says.</p>
<p word_count="29">“Can I, like, get out?” she says, her throat parched, her voice a whisper. Did she sleep with her mouth open? Christ, what if she’d snored—or <em>drooled</em>?</p>
<p word_count="67">Aisle Guy starts to do the leg-twist thing but then, thinking better of it, stands and steps into the aisle, but forward instead of backward, so he’s still in her way, and they have to shimmy past each other. She walks to the lavatory on unsteady legs, feeling watched by every passenger as she makes her half-stumbling progress, pins and needles singing hotly in her feet.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="100">There’s no question of going back to sleep, so she reads for a while. But she can’t keep Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton straight, and what does it matter? She has all week. She had planned to buy Wi-Fi for the flight but she slept so long it isn’t worth it now, plus she’d have to go to the back of the plane and ask her mom for the credit card. Eff that. She takes her phone and earbuds out of her bag and puts some music on. Thumbs whateverly at Candy Crush while she listens.</p>
<p word_count="48">But <em>of course</em> at the exact moment that the captain announces the initial descent Fat Hawaii says she needs to use the bathroom. Charity and Aisle Guy both have to get up. This time, at least, he stands in the right place and there’s room for everyone.</p>
<p word_count="23">“You live in Seattle?” he asks as they sit down. She has one earbud back in and the other waiting in her hand.</p>
<p word_count="16">“No, I’m visiting Grams—my grandmother. Me and my mom are. For, like, a week.”</p>
<p word_count="14">“I’m on the road,” he says. “Boston, Seattle, then Dallas. This whole month.”</p>
<p word_count="27">“O.K.,” Charity says, but then, feeling vaguely like she owes him, summons up a modicum of pity, clears her throat, and asks him about his job.</p>
<p word_count="28">“Oh, it’s boring. I don’t know if they teach you this in school, but boredom is where money comes from. You plant boredom and money grows.”</p>
<p word_count="11">“Dude, if that was true I’d be rich as hell.”</p>
<p word_count="5">“You get bored, do you?”</p>
<p word_count="25">She laughs—almost snorts. “Uh, <em>yeah</em>. They make all these movies about high school being whatever but then it’s just like—<em>school</em>. You know?”</p>
<p word_count="9">“I’m Mark,” he says. “What’s your name?”</p>
<p word_count="1">“Charity.”</p>
<p word_count="4">“Charity. That’s pretty.”</p>
<p word_count="10">She can feel her cheeks warming. “I don’t know.”</p>
<p word_count="6">“No, really. It is. You are.”</p>
<p word_count="7">“O.K. I mean, thank you. Thanks.”</p>
<p word_count="106">Mark reaches into his shirt pocket and produces a cream-colored rectangle and an expensive-looking pen. There’s a name and a title and an e-mail address and some logo printed on the front side—it does in fact look boring as hell—but then he flips it over. On the reverse side, he scribbles a phone number and a pair of words. His handwriting is crowded but precise. “This is my cell and where I’m staying,” he says, reaching across her lap to slip the card between the pages of “A Tale of Two Cities.” He pushes it all the way in until it disappears.</p>
<a class="tny-slot" name="/4" data-total-words="1684"></a>
<p word_count="56">Mark moves his hand away from the book, and Charity thinks he might fake-accidentally brush her breast, the way boys at school sometimes do. But Mark is not a schoolboy and instead palms her inner thigh and squeezes it, two pumps, the second one a hard one, his wrist digging against the crotch of her jeans.</p>
<p word_count="36">“Call me when you get bored, Charity,” he says. His pretzel breath hot on her cheek. Then Fat Hawaii is back and he stands to greet her and Charity has no choice but to follow suit.</p>
<p word_count="34">He ignores her for the rest of the flight, busying himself with his papers. Fat Hawaii prays loudly as the world rushes close out the window, then applauds when the plane touches down safely.</p>
<a class="tny-page" name="/3" data-total-words="1810"></a>
<p word_count="63">As soon as they finish taxiing, Mark unbuckles his seat belt and steps into the aisle. He gets his bag down and holds it in front of him and looks straight ahead. In the terminal, he takes hurried strides, and the crowds swallow him. When her mom emerges, finally, they ask each other how the flight was and both say it was fine.</p>
<p word_count="6">“Did you sleep?” her mom asks.</p>
<p word_count="24">“No,” Charity says. “A little. You don’t need to worry about me.” She starts walking. They make their way through the teeming hall.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="239">Charity establishes herself in Grams’s basement; it’s only lightly finished, and the foldout cot isn’t super comfortable, but it beats sharing the guest room with her mom. The main thing is to avoid having to deal with anybody, which turns out to be easier than she thought it would be. After a couple of days she’s kind of stir-crazy. When she isn’t slogging through “A Tale of Two Cities,” she keeps her earbuds in and texts with Lexie, or sometimes with Evan, who’s this boy from school. She’s hung out with Evan a few times, and once, at a party, in an upstairs bathroom, let him get to second base. Under the shirt but over the bra. But lately this girl, Jenna, who goes to private school, is all over his Instagram. Not like <em>in</em> pictures with him, just hearting every single post and sometimes leaving “first!” as a comment, which for Jenna’s own sake Charity hopes is irony, but who can say. Lexie thinks Evan is a loser, which yeah maybe, but he’s funny and easy to be around, so if he texts her she usually texts him back, sometimes right away and sometimes after waiting some random amount of time. And sometimes, like right now, she texts him first. “My grams is losing it. All she does is clean the same clean shit. She’s like bleaching bleach.”</p>
<p word_count="89">It’s three hours later in Boston. Last period at school, which for Evan is study hall, so he’s either doodling in his notebook or messing around on his phone under the table, the latter, probably, since he texts her right back: “Whoa harsh.” Charity can’t tell if he means that what she’s dealing with is harsh or if she herself is being harsh, so she parries with a nonsensical string of emoji: a crystal ball, a party horn, four or five roosters, a smirking moon.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="98">The main mission of this trip is to see how bad things have got with Grams, and to try to figure out what should happen next. To get a sense of—and maybe some control over—Grams’s finances: bank accounts; stocks and bonds, if there are any; plus of course the mortgage and will situations. This would be slow going even if Grams, a fiercely independent woman, were at her best. Now that she’s forgetting stuff, she covers for her lapses with a viciousness that makes people scared to deal with her. Which is the point.</p>
<p word_count="297">Charity is used to seeing Grams once or twice a year—Christmas in Boston, maybe a weeklong visit to Seattle in the summer or over spring break. But Grams has mostly stopped travelling and, come to think of it, this is the first time they’ve made it out to see her in two or three years. Life is busy and money’s always tight and time gets away from you. That’s what her mom says. And that the important thing is they’re here now: spending quality time, getting the lay of the land. Charity’s scared that Grams might need to come live with them. She is an only child and doesn’t think that she can learn to share her space with someone who, while obviously the opposite of a child, will increasingly have a child’s needs and make a child’s demands. She hopes Grams can go live with Aunt Jan and Uncle Dennis in Florida. They have a big house all to themselves, since Kyle is away at college. Or maybe Grams will want to stay in Seattle and they’ll put her in a nursing home, though how would they pay for it and when would they ever visit her? The whole thing, when Charity tries to think about it, gets overwhelming really fast. She pushes it into a far corner of her mind and leaves it there, like how when she was a kid sometimes she’d want to help her mom clean the house but then get distracted between the broom part and the dustpan part, so the hair balls and dead bugs and other crud ended up heaped and forgotten in this nasty little pile in the corner, to be dealt with later—or else not.</p>
<a class="tny-slot" name="/5" data-total-words="2626"></a>
<p word_count="13">No further word from Evan. She puts her phone down and goes upstairs.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="120">Charity’s mom is going stir-crazy, too, apparently, because she suggests that they all head downtown and do some sightseeing. Grams has “The View” going at top volume on all the TVs: living room, bedroom, and the little countertop one in the kitchen, where she stands in her nightgown, plunging a mop into a bucket of hot water. Charity’s mom points out that the kitchen is spotless; the whole house is. “It may seem that way to <em>you</em>,” Grams says, “but <em>some</em> of us have different <em>standards</em>.” She hits the key words as though they were posts she’s driving into the ground. She means to raise a high, strong fence around herself and then cower inside it alone.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="33">“Will she be O.K.?” Charity asks as they get into Grams’s car, which Grams never drives anymore. The engine sputters to life as if roused from a long but restless sleep.</p>
<p word_count="22">“She’s made it this far,” her mom says. “The more immediate question is whether <em>I’m</em> going to be O.K.”</p>
<a class="tny-page" name="/4" data-total-words="2814"></a>
<p word_count="3">“We,” Charity says.</p>
<p word_count="18">“Oh, Sweetie,” her mom says. “Don’t be dramatic. Of course you’re going to be O.K.”</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="103">After the Space Needle they go to Pike Place, where Charity takes a picture of her mom taking a picture of a group of Asian tourists who are taking turns posing for pictures in front of the original Starbucks. She texts the picture to Lexie and then separately to Evan. She makes her mom buy her a smoothie from a juice stall and they walk over to a little park to share it, but they can’t find a spot far enough away from the homeless people so they go back to the market and shuffle up and down the row of stalls.</p>
<p word_count="92">Charity wants to go to the aquarium, which is right down the block. They even talked about it earlier, but now her mom doesn’t want to. She’s doing that thing Charity hates, where she pretends to weigh options when really her mind is already made up. “I dunno, Sweetie. Probably we should get back to Grams sooner than later, don’t you think. Maybe let’s give it a shot another day, ’kay.” Questions that don’t end in question marks—this means they’re never going to the aquarium.</p>
<p word_count="3">“Whatever,” Charity says.</p>
<p word_count="97">They walk back to the car on a different street from the one they came down. Charity, lost in sulky reverie, keeps her eyes on her shoes and the black-gummed sidewalk as they make their way up a steep hill that she is pleased to notice leaves her mom short of breath. At the top, waiting for a light to change, Charity looks up and is utterly shocked to see, on the façade of a building kitty-corner from where she stands, the words Mark wrote on his card, tall and cut from metal and brightly lit.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="86">She has meant to tell Lexie about Mark, has <em>almost</em> told her a few times, but then at the last second held back. Sharing her secret with her best friend would be fun in one way, but keeping it to herself—making it really her secret—is fun in a different way, at least for now. Besides, what if the story isn’t over yet? She’d rather tell it all when she gets home and can enjoy the pink shock flushing across Lexie’s face.</p>
<a class="tny-slot" name="/6" data-total-words="3216"></a>
<p word_count="11"><em>He did</em> what? <em>And what did</em> you <em>do</em>? <em>Holy</em> fuck, <em>Char</em>.</p>
<p word_count="113">Grams goes to bed after dinner and her mom isn’t long in following. Charity finds Mark’s card in her book. She punches his number into her phone but doesn’t hit Call. She stares at the digits glowing black and thin in the iPhone font. She presses Create New Contact and saves him as “Mark Perv.” She googles his area code: Phoenix. This tells her nothing. She could look up his company, but who cares? She maps his hotel and looks at the route suggestions. She scrolls through some photos of sample rooms. This is stupid. She sends Mark Perv a text that says, “Hey dude its charity from the plane”</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="43">She reads her book for a while, relishing being the last person awake in the house. When this small but definitive luxury has spent itself she changes into terry-cloth shorts and a T-shirt and pads upstairs to the bathroom to brush her teeth.</p>
<p word_count="32">As she’s going back down, she sees an angelic haze rising through the darkness and knows that it must be her phone. Sure enough, there’s a text from Mark Perv.</p>
<p word_count="3">“So u bored?”</p>
<p word_count="9">She’s workshopping witty retorts when he texts again.</p>
<p word_count="3">“Whatre you wearing?”</p>
<p word_count="6">“Pajamas I guess, like a shirt”</p>
<p word_count="1">“Bra?”</p>
<p word_count="5">“Who sleeps in a bra?”</p>
<p word_count="3">“U near me?”</p>
<p word_count="5">“I’m in some suburb”</p>
<p word_count="10">“Tell me where ur at I’ll get a taxi”</p>
<p word_count="6">“Can’t cuz of my family”</p>
<p word_count="7">“I’ll pay for yours thats easy”</p>
<p word_count="7">“Really can’t . . . Maybe tmrw i dunno”</p>
<p word_count="6">“Can i get a pic then?”</p>
<p word_count="3">“What? No way!”</p>
<p word_count="11">“Cmon sumthing to look fwd to ur teasing me bad here”</p>
<p word_count="5">“Will u send one back?”</p>
<p word_count="3">“Now were talking”</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="64">She lies down on the floor, knees in the air, as if preparing to do sit-ups. She’s pleased with her thighs, smooth and blanched pale by the camera flash, but that’s not enough, somehow, so she pulls her shirt up to show off her hip bones and the downslope of her abdomen, extends her legs into a pseudo-yoga pose, and tries again.</p>
<p word_count="11">Her purple-painted toenails like weird stars in the grainy basement sky.</p>
<p word_count="110">The picture, she thinks, looks like an American Apparel ad. Her shorts are blue with white piping, and, because of how she positioned herself, are taut around her crotch, the bulge of it clearly articulated and more than she’d intended to show. But it’s less revealing than some American Apparel ads, which are in, like, magazines and on the sides of buses, so whatever. She sends the picture to Mark. He replies with a closeup of the head of his cock, its skin nubbled and flushed, a shiny pearl of semen in the opening, which Charity has never before had occasion to notice is vertical, like a vagina.</p>
<p word_count="11">The tip of Mark’s penis looks like a tiny vagina.</p>
<p word_count="124">Charity puts her phone on silent and sticks it down at the bottom of her purse. She needs a minute to think, or rather to not think, about some choices she is somewhat pleased to now have, but does not necessarily want to make right away. <em>I’m gonna do whatever I’m gonna do</em>, she thinks, and takes out “A Tale of Two Cities,” knowing she won’t be able to concentrate on it, but trying to anyway. One word and then the next, like rungs on a ladder. Sentences, paragraphs, pages. The revolution happens and everyone has such high hopes but then it all gets terrible. She puts the book down at the end of a chapter and wills herself to sleep.</p>
<a class="tny-page" name="/5" data-total-words="3828"></a>
<p class="descender" word_count="80">The next morning she checks her phone and sees that the battery died during the night. She plugs it in and goes upstairs. Back home Lexie and Evan are already at lunch. Charity feels outside of time and the world a little, which is scary but also cool, and if it’s true then maybe things that happen here in this other time register differently, matter less—or more, which is also possible—on the, like, cosmic or whatever scale.</p>
<p word_count="34">She finds Grams seated at the kitchen table and joins her. Grams is holding a slice of toasted Pepperidge Farm white bread over a china saucer. No coffee cup or coffee to be seen.</p>
<p word_count="11">“So he’s gone, then,” Grams says, putting the toast down.</p>
<p word_count="1">“Huh?”</p>
<p word_count="58">“I guess you wouldn’t be here if he wasn’t. Well, I’m sorry for you, sorrier for the baby, but not half sorry to see the last of that piece of shit. And it will be the last, or pretty nearly. You’ll be lucky if he sends Charity a birthday card, much less child support.”</p>
<a class="tny-slot" name="/7" data-total-words="4012"></a>
<p word_count="6">“Grams,” she says. “<em>I’m</em> Charity.”</p>
<p word_count="20">Grams slams the heel of her hand on the table, sending the toast and the saucer crashing to the floor.</p>
<p word_count="21">“<em>Moooooom</em>,” Charity cries, her voice rising like a siren, sounding even to her own ears like that of a frightened child.</p>
<p word_count="90">Her mom emerges, a few long seconds later, bleary and grumbling, from the guest room, and this seems to calm Grams; her lucidity returns like a dislocated joint pulled back into place. Charity, her eyes wet, walks across the kitchen. She pulls a paper towel off the roll and runs it under the faucet, then kneels to clean the shards of toast and china from the floor. Grams announces that she is going to her room to get dressed. It’s well past time, she says, to start the day.</p>
<p word_count="46">When the bedroom door closes, Charity’s mom grabs the cordless phone from its wall-mounted cradle and starts making calls—the G.P. first, then the neurologist, and then Aunt Jan. Charity finishes cleaning up, then goes downstairs to recover her aloofness and get dressed, too.</p>
<p word_count="70">When she gets back upstairs, Grams is still in her room, maybe hiding from them, while her mom sits at the kitchen table. There is a gray burst at the crown of her mom’s head, and Charity knows that this is because her mom’s regular appointment with the colorist had to be rescheduled. Because some things can be put off and others can’t, or can’t anymore.</p>
<p word_count="62">Her mom’s fingertips are at her temples, the cordless trapped between her ear and her shoulder as she stares down at a yellow scratch pad on which nothing is yet written. Charity says she wants to go downtown and see the aquarium. Her mom puts her hand over the mouthpiece of the phone; a pointless gesture, since she’s on hold.</p>
<p word_count="12">“Take two twenties from my purse. Check in in two hours. ’Kay?”</p>
<p word_count="1">“Mom.”</p>
<p word_count="79">“Charity.” They might have gone on like this, but then whoever has her mom on hold comes back on the line. The pen starts moving across the paper. Charity’s sneakers are by the front door. As she laces and ties them, she thinks about going back into the kitchen, sitting down with her mom. She can almost see herself doing it. But she has her sliver of freedom to protect, a day of her own ahead of her.</p>
<p word_count="12">“Love you,” she calls out, then leaves without waiting for a reply.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="76">On the light rail Charity has a whole bench to herself. She stretches her legs across the seats, then wriggles the phone out of her jeans pocket and turns it on. There are literally dozens of texts from Mark Perv waiting for her, which is both surprising and not. She expected something from him, had been perhaps counting on something, but this is above and beyond. She scrolls up to the beginning and reads in order.</p>
<p word_count="43">First he sent another shot of his junk, with the balls in it this time, then he asked for more pictures from Charity. His requests are super specific! They read like doctor’s instructions—<em>open wide</em>—or the rules of some ridiculous game.</p>
<p word_count="29">But, if this is a game, Charity thinks with rising indignation, Mark has cheated. They’ve barely begun playing and here he’s gone and skipped all her turns.</p>
<p word_count="105">His messages go from sweetly solicitous to powerfully angry, then back again. He accuses her of misleading him and calls her all sorts of names, then suddenly regains himself, tries to feign a degree of belated cool. He says he’s sorry if he scared her or came on too strong; she can trust him. It’s O.K.—really, honest—if she needs time to think. But also she’s a stupid little bitch playing with fire and bound to get burned. He’s going to fuck her ass so hard that when she goes back to the airport she’ll need a wheelchair.</p>
<p word_count="12"><em>Jesus</em>, she thinks. <em>Next he’ll be offering to push the wheelchair.</em></p>
<p word_count="13">The last text, sent after a few hours’ lapse, is time-stamped 5:57 <small>A.M.</small></p>
<p word_count="12">“So yr just what gone while im risk <small>EVERTHING</small>? so fuckin lame”</p>
<p word_count="115">She imagines the thunder of Mark’s blood in his ears as he harangued and pleaded. She wonders if he will hear that thunder again when his life comes crashing down around him—that is, if she reports him, which she knows she should. She knows the guidance-counsellor language for what is happening here. But ratting out Mark will mean telling the story, having to explain herself, over and over, to anyone who can make her tell it, cops and her mom, kids at school, after word gets out. Evan, for example, who, come to think of it, still hasn’t texted her back. She thinks about texting him: <em>So you’re just what, gone</em>?</p>

<p word_count="137">The Mark thing will make so much less sense out loud than it did when she did it, or even than it does now as she goes over it in her head. That’s the most unfair part. Everyone will have their own version of “What were you thinking?” and “Why did you do that?” Like her life is some book she needs to write a report about, identifying key themes and meaning, when, really, texting Mark was like peeking in the doorway of a bar or the teachers’ lounge—someplace you could get in trouble for going into but were curious to glimpse the inside of, just to be able to say that you knew what was in there. And maybe someone had dared you to do it and maybe you had had to dare yourself.</p>
<p class="descender" word_count="74">The aquarium is mobbed with schoolkids on a field trip, seven- and eight-year-olds in yellow polo shirts with a crest stitched over the breast. They stick their hands in the touch pools, stroking anemones, spiny urchins, and orange starfish you can see moving only if you look close. Gray stingrays, their venom removed, jockey for position as they take laps around a tank. Kids reach in to swipe at them as they go past.</p>
<p word_count="46">When the tour guide calls the kids to attention and starts talking about the different kinds of sea life, Charity finds herself listening, following along as they make their way through the main hall to an outdoor pool, where some otters are playing in the sun.</p>
<p word_count="63">An employee emerges from a door in the back wall, carrying a bucket of cut-up fish. Charity figures he’ll make the otters do tricks for pieces, but instead he takes the bucket in both hands and swings it. With her phone, she takes a perfect shot of the mass as it unfurls over the water in a hail of innards and scales.</p>
<p word_count="161">She turns her back on the feasting otters, moves away from the kids. She opens her mouth as wide as it will go and retracts her tongue, like an eel in its lair. She puts the phone in her mouth, its glass face clicking against the back of her top front teeth, warm metal resting on her lower lip. She takes a picture. The roof of her mouth is a spidery pink dome. Below it, the curve of her tongue is a half-sunk moon casting a shadow into the gulp of her throat, above which her uvula hangs like a second moon, a full one, this alien world within her, shining like surgery. She pairs the two pictures together in a single Instagram post, no filters. She tags Lexie and Evan and some of their friends, plus private-school Jenna and, for good measure, a few total strangers who somehow or other found her feed and, for whatever reason, became her followers.</p>
