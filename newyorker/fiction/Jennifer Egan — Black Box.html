<h2>1</h2>
<p>People rarely look the way you expect them to, even when you&#8217;ve seen pictures.</p>
<p>The first thirty seconds in a person&#8217;s presence are the most important.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble perceiving and projecting, focus on projecting.</p>
<p>Necessary ingredients for a successful projection: giggles; bare legs; shyness.</p>
<p>The goal is to be both irresistible and invisible.</p>
<p>When you succeed, a certain sharpness will go out of his eyes.</p>
<h2>2</h2>
<p>Some powerful men actually call their beauties &#8220;Beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Counter to reputation, there is a deep camaraderie among beauties.</p>
<p>If your Designated Mate is widely feared, the beauties at the house party where you&#8217;ve gone undercover to meet him will be especially kind.</p>
<p>Kindness feels good, even when it&#8217;s based on a false notion of your identity and purpose.</p>
<h2>3</h2>
<p>Posing as a beauty means not reading what you would like to read on a rocky shore in the South of France.</p>
<p>Sunlight on bare skin can be as nourishing as food.</p>
<p>Even a powerful man will be briefly self-conscious when he first disrobes to his bathing suit.</p>
<p>It is technically impossible for a man to look better in a Speedo than in swim trunks.</p>
<p>If you love someone with dark skin, white skin looks drained of something vital.</p>
<h2>4</h2>
<p>When you know that a person is violent and ruthless, you will see violent ruthlessness in such basic things as his swim stroke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; from your Designated Mate amid choppy waves after he has followed you into the sea may or may not betray suspicion.</p>
<p>Your reply&#8212;&#8220;Swimming&#8221;&#8212;may or may not be perceived as sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we swim together toward those rocks?&#8221; may or may not be a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that way?&#8221; will, if spoken correctly, sound ingenuous.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have privacy there&#8221; may sound unexpectedly ominous.</p>
<h2>5</h2>
<p>A hundred feet of blue-black Mediterranean will allow you ample time to deliver a strong self-lecture.</p>
<p>At such moments, it may be useful to explicitly recall your training:</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be infiltrating the lives of criminals.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be in constant danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of you will not survive, but those who do will be heroes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few of you will save lives and even change the course of history.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ask of you an impossible combination of traits: ironclad scruples and a willingness to violate them;</p>
<p>&#8220;An abiding love for your country and a willingness to consort with individuals who are working actively to destroy it;</p>
<p>&#8220;The instincts and intuition of experts, and the blank records and true freshness of ing&#233;nues.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will each perform this service only once, after which you will return to your lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot promise that your lives will be exactly the same when you go back to them.&#8221;</p>
<h2>6</h2>
<p>Eagerness and pliability can be expressed even in the way you climb from the sea onto chalky yellow rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a very fast swimmer,&#8221; uttered by a man who is still submerged, may not be intended as praise.</p>
<p>Giggling is sometimes better than answering.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a lovely girl&#8221; may be meant straightforwardly.</p>
<p>Ditto &#8220;I want to fuck you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well? What do you think about that?&#8221; suggests a preference for direct verbal responses over giggling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it&#8221; must be uttered with enough gusto to compensate for a lack of declarative color.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t sound sure&#8221; indicates insufficient gusto.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <em>not</em> sure&#8221; is acceptable only when followed, coyly, with &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to convince me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throwing back your head and closing your eyes allows you to give the appearance of sexual readiness while concealing revulsion.</p>
<h2>7</h2>
<p>Being alone with a violent and ruthless man, surrounded by water, can make the shore seem very far away.</p>
<p>You may feel solidarity, at such a time, with the beauties just visible there in their bright bikinis.</p>
<p>You may appreciate, at such a time, why you aren&#8217;t being paid for this work.</p>
<p>Your voluntary service is the highest form of patriotism.</p>
<p>Remind yourself that you aren&#8217;t being paid when he climbs out of the water and lumbers toward you.</p>
<p>Remind yourself that you aren&#8217;t being paid when he leads you behind a boulder and pulls you onto his lap.</p>
<p>The Dissociation Technique is like a parachute&#8212;you must pull the cord at the correct time.</p>
<p>Too soon, and you may hinder your ability to function at a crucial moment;</p>
<p>Too late, and you will be lodged too deeply inside the action to wriggle free.</p>
<p>You will be tempted to pull the cord when he surrounds you with arms whose bulky strength reminds you, fleetingly, of your husband&#8217;s.</p>
<p>You will be tempted to pull it when you feel him start to move against you from below.</p>
<p>You will be tempted to pull it when his smell envelops you: metallic, like a warm hand clutching pennies.</p>
<p>The directive &#8220;Relax&#8221; suggests that your discomfort is palpable.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one can see us&#8221; suggests that your discomfort has been understood as fear of physical exposure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Relax, relax,&#8221; uttered in rhythmic, throaty tones, suggests that your discomfort is not unwelcome.</p>
<h2>8</h2>
<p>Begin the Dissociation Technique only when physical violation is imminent.</p>
<p>Close your eyes and slowly count backward from ten.</p>
<p>With each number, imagine yourself rising out of your body and moving one step farther away from it.</p>
<p>By eight, you should be hovering just outside your skin.</p>
<p>By five, you should be floating a foot or two above your body, feeling only vague anxiety over what is about to happen to it.</p>
<p>By three, you should feel fully detached from your physical self.</p>
<p>By two, your body should be able to act and react without your participation.</p>
<p>By one, your mind should drift so free that you lose track of what is happening below.</p>
<p>White clouds spin and curl.</p>
<p>A blue sky is as depthless as the sea.</p>
<p>The sound of waves against rocks existed millennia before there were creatures who could hear it.</p>
<p>Spurs and gashes of stone narrate a violence that the earth itself has long forgotten.</p>
<p>Your mind will rejoin your body when it is safe to do so.</p>
<h2>9</h2>
<p>Return to your body carefully, as if you were re&#235;ntering your home after a hurricane.</p>
<p>Resist the impulse to reconstruct what has just happened.</p>
<p>Focus instead on gauging your Designated Mate&#8217;s reaction to the new intimacy between you.</p>
<p>In some men, intimacy will prompt a more callous, indifferent attitude.</p>
<p>In others, intimacy may awaken problematic curiosity about you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you learn to swim like that?,&#8221; uttered lazily, while supine, with two fingers in your hair, indicates curiosity.</p>
<p>Tell the truth without precision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up near a lake&#8221; is both true and vague.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was the lake?&#8221; conveys dissatisfaction with your vagueness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Columbia County, New York&#8221; suggests precision while avoiding it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manhattan?&#8221; betrays unfamiliarity with the geography of New York State.</p>
<p>Never contradict your Designated Mate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did <em>you</em> grow up?,&#8221; asked of a man who has just asked you the same thing, is known as &#8220;mirroring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mirror your Designated Mate&#8217;s attitudes, interests, desires, and tastes.</p>
<p>Your goal is to become part of his atmosphere: a source of comfort and ease.</p>
<p>Only then will he drop his guard when you are near.</p>
<p>Only then will he have significant conversations within your earshot.</p>
<p>Only then will he leave his possessions in a porous and unattended state. </p>
<p>Only then can you begin to gather information systematically.</p>
<h2>10</h2>
<p>&#8220;Come. Let&#8217;s go back,&#8221; uttered brusquely, suggests that your Designated Mate has no more wish to talk about himself than you do.</p>
<p>Avoid the temptation to analyze his moods and whims.</p>
<p>Salt water has a cleansing effect.</p>
<h2>11</h2>
<p>You will see knowledge of your new intimacy with your Designated Mate in the eyes of every beauty on shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saved lunch for you&#8221; may or may not be an allusion to the reason for your absence.</p>
<p>Cold fish is unappealing, even when served in a good lemon sauce.</p>
<p>Be friendly to other beauties, but not solicitous.</p>
<p>When you are in conversation with a beauty, it is essential that you be perceived as no more or less than she is.</p>
<p>Be truthful about every aspect of your life except marriage (if any).</p>
<p>If married, say that you and your spouse have divorced, to give an impression of unfettered freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s sad!&#8221; suggests that the beauty you&#8217;re chatting with would like to marry. you&#8217;re chatting with would like to marry.</p>
<h2>12</h2>
<p>If your Designated Mate abruptly veers toward the villa, follow him.</p>
<p>Taking his hand and smiling congenially can create a sense of low-key accompaniment.</p>
<p>An abstracted smile in return, as if he&#8217;d forgotten who you are, may be a sign of pressing concerns.</p>
<p>The concerns of your Designated Mate are your concerns.</p>
<p>The room assigned to a powerful man will be more lavish than the one you slept in while awaiting his arrival.</p>
<p>Never look for hidden cameras: the fact that you&#8217;re looking will give you away.</p>
<p>Determine whether your Designated Mate seeks physical intimacy; if not, feign the wish for a nap.</p>
<p>Your pretense of sleep will allow him to feel that he is alone.</p>
<p>Curling up under bedclothes, even those belonging to an enemy subject, may be soothing.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re more likely to hear his handset vibrate if your eyes are closed.</p>
<h2>13</h2>
<p>A door sliding open signals his wish to take the call on the balcony.</p>
<p>Your Designated Mate&#8217;s important conversations will take place outdoors.</p>
<p>If you are within earshot of his conversation, record it.</p>
<p>Since beauties carry neither pocketbooks nor timepieces, you cannot credibly transport recording devices.</p>
<p>A microphone has been implanted just beyond the first turn of your right ear canal.</p>
<p>Activate the microphone by pressing the triangle of cartilage across your ear opening.</p>
<p>You will hear a faint whine as recording begins.</p>
<p>In extreme quiet, or to a person whose head is adjacent to yours, this whine may be audible.</p>
<p>Should the whine be detected, swat your ear as if to deflect a mosquito, hitting the on/off cartilage to deactivate the mike.</p>
<p>You need not identify or comprehend the language your subject is using.</p>
<p>Your job is proximity; if you are near your Designated Mate, recording his private speech, you are succeeding.</p>
<p>Profanity sounds the same in every language.</p>
<p>An angry subject will guard his words less carefully.</p>
<h2>14</h2>
<p>If your subject is angry, you may leave your camouflage position and move as close to him as possible to improve recording quality.</p>
<p>You may feel afraid as you do this.</p>
<p>Your pounding heartbeat will not be recorded.</p>
<p>If your Designated Mate is standing on a balcony, hover in the doorway just behind him. </p>
<p>If he pivots and discovers you, pretend that you were on the verge of approaching him.</p>
<p>Anger usually trumps suspicion.</p>
<p>If your subject brushes past you and storms out of the room, slamming the door, you have eluded detection. </p>
<h2>15</h2>
<p>If your Designated Mate leaves your company a second time, don&#8217;t follow him again.</p>
<p>Deactivate your ear mike and resume your &#8220;nap.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment of repose may be a good time to reassure your loved ones.</p>
<p>Nuanced communication is too easily monitored by the enemy. </p>
<p>Your Subcutaneous Pulse System issues pings so generic that detection would reveal neither source nor intent.</p>
<p>A button is embedded behind the inside ligament of your right knee (if right-handed).</p>
<p>Depress twice to indicate to loved ones that you are well and thinking of them.</p>
<p>You may send this signal only once each day.</p>
<p>A continuous depression of the button indicates an emergency.</p>
<p>You will debate, each day, the best time to send your signal.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that your husband, coming from a culture of tribal allegiance, understands and applauds your patriotism.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the enclosed and joyful life that the two of you have shared since graduate school.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that America is your husband&#8217;s chosen country, and that he loves it.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that your husband&#8217;s rise to prominence would have been unimaginable in any other nation.</p>
<p>You will reflect on your joint conviction that your service had to be undertaken before you had children.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that you are thirty-three, and have spent your professional life fomenting musical trends.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that you must return home the same person you were when you left.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that you&#8217;ve been guaranteed you will <em>not</em> be the same person.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that you had stopped being that person even before leaving.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that too much reflection is pointless.</p>
<p>You will reflect on the fact that these &#8220;instructions&#8221; are becoming less and less instructive.</p>
<p>Your Field Instructions, stored in a chip beneath your hairline, will serve as both a mission log and a guide for others undertaking this work.</p>
<p>Pressing your left thumb (if right-handed) against your left middle fingertip begins recording.</p>
<p>For clearest results, mentally speak the thought, as if talking to yourself.</p>
<p>Always filter your observations and experience through the lens of their didactic value.</p>
<p>Your training is ongoing; you must learn from each step you take.</p>
<p>When your mission is complete, you may view the results of the download before adding your Field Instructions to your mission file.</p>
<p>Where stray or personal thoughts have intruded, you may delete them.</p>
<h2>16</h2>
<p>Pretend sleep can lead to actual sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep is restorative in almost every circumstance.</p>
<p>The sound of showering likely indicates the return of your Designated Mate.</p>
<p>As a beauty, you will be expected to return to your room and change clothes often; a fresh appearance at mealtimes is essential.</p>
<p>The goal is to be a lovely, innocuous, evolving surprise.</p>
<p>A crisp white sundress against tanned skin is widely viewed as attractive.</p>
<p>Avoid overbright colors; they are attention-seeking and hinder camouflage.</p>
<p>White is not, technically speaking, a bright color.</p>
<p>White is, nevertheless, bright.</p>
<p>Gold spike-heeled sandals may compromise your ability to run or jump, but they look good on tanned feet.</p>
<p>Thirty-three is still young enough to register as &#8220;young.&#8221;</p>
<p>Registering as &#8220;young&#8221; is especially welcome to those who may not register as &#8220;young&#8221; much longer.</p>
<p>If your Designated Mate leads you to dinner with an arm at your waist, assume that your attire change was successful.</p>
<h2>17</h2>
<p>When men begin serious talk, beauties are left to themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been divorced?&#8221; suggests the wish to resume a prior conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few months,&#8221; when untrue, should be uttered without eye contact.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was he like, your husband?&#8221; may be answered honestly. </p>
<p>&#8220;From Africa. Kenya&#8221; will satisfy your wish to talk about your husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black?,&#8221; with eyebrows raised, may indicate racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Black,&#8221; in measured tones, should deliver a gentle reprimand.</p>
<p>&#8220;How black?&#8221; suggests that it did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very black&#8221; is somewhat less gentle, especially when accompanied by a pointed stare. </p>
<p>&#8220;Nice&#8221; hints at personal experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It is nice&#8221; contradicts one&#8217;s alleged divorce. &#8220;Was nice&#8221; is a reasonable correction.</p>
<p>&#8220;But not nice enough?,&#8221; with laughter, indicates friendly intimacy. Especially when followed by &#8220;Or too nice!&#8221;</p>
<h2>18</h2>
<p>House-party hosts are universally eager to make guests eat.</p>
<p>For most beauties, the lure of food is a hazard; as a beauty of limited tenure, you may eat what you want.</p>
<p>Squab can be consumed by ripping the bird apart with your hands and sucking the meat from the bones.</p>
<p>A stunned expression reveals that your host expected the use of utensils.</p>
<p>A host who caters to violent guests will understand implicitly the need for discretion.</p>
<p>The adjacency of your host&#8217;s chair to your own may presage a confidence. </p>
<p>If your job is to appear simpleminded, a confidence may mean that you have failed.</p>
<p>Everyone should brush his teeth before dinner.</p>
<p>Turning your ear toward your host&#8217;s mouth will prevent you from having to smell the breath coming from it.</p>
<p>Ears must be kept clean at all times.</p>
<p>If your host warns you that your Designated Mate may pose an immediate danger to you, assume that your Designated Mate has left the room.</p>
<h2>19</h2>
<p>Going to the rest room is the most efficient means of self-jettisoning.</p>
<p>Never betray urgency, not even in an empty hallway.</p>
<p>If you have no idea in which direction your Designated Mate has gone, hold still.</p>
<p>If you find yourself hovering beside a pair of glass doors, you may open them and step outside.</p>
<p>Nights in the South of France are a strange, dark, piercing blue.</p>
<p>A bright moon can astonish, no matter how many times you have seen it.</p>
<p>If you were a child who loved the moon, looking at the moon will forever remind you of childhood.</p>
<p>Fatherless girls may invest the moon with a certain paternal promise.</p>
<p>Everyone has a father.</p>
<p>A vague story like &#8220;Your father died before you were born&#8221; may satisfy a curious child for an unlikely number of years.</p>
<p>The truth of your paternity, discovered in adulthood, will make the lie seem retroactively ludicrous.</p>
<p>Publicists occasionally have flings with their movie-star clients.</p>
<p>Discovering that you are a movie star&#8217;s daughter is not necessarily a comfort.</p>
<p>It is especially not a comfort when the star in question has seven other children from three different marriages.</p>
<p>Discovering that you are a movie star&#8217;s daughter may prompt you to watch upward of sixty movies, dating from the beginning of his career.</p>
<p>You may think, watching said movies, You don&#8217;t know about me, but I am here.</p>
<p>You may think, watching said movies, I&#8217;m invisible to you, but I am here.</p>
<p>A sudden reconfiguration of your past can change the fit and feel of your adulthood.</p>
<p>It may cleave you, irreparably, from the mother whose single goal has been your happiness.</p>
<p>If your husband has transformed greatly in his own life, he will understand your transformation.</p>
<p>Avoid excessive self-reflection; your job is to look out, not in.</p>
<h2>20</h2>
<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; whispered from behind by your Designated Mate, suggests that he has been looking for you.</p>
<p>Holding still can sometimes prove more effective than actively searching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; uttered softly, may communicate a renewed wish for intimate contact.</p>
<p>The moon&#8217;s calm face can make you feel, in advance, that you are understood and forgiven.</p>
<p>The sea is audible against the rocks well before you see it.</p>
<p>Even at night, the Mediterranean is more blue than black.</p>
<p>If you wish to avoid physical intimacy, the sight of a speedboat will bring relief, despite the myriad new problems it presents.</p>
<p>If no words are exchanged between your Designated Mate and the speedboat&#8217;s captain, their meeting was likely prearranged.</p>
<p>A man known for his cruelty may still show great care in guiding his beauty into a rocking speedboat.</p>
<p>He may interpret her hesitation to board as a fear of falling in.</p>
<p>Resist the impulse to ask where you are going.</p>
<p>Try, when anxious, to summon up a goofy giggle.</p>
<p>Locate your Personal Calming Source and use it.</p>
<p>If your Personal Calming Source is the moon, be grateful that it is dark and that the moon is especially bright.</p>
<p>Reflect on the many reasons you can&#8217;t yet die:</p>
<p>You need to see your husband.</p>
<p>You need to have children.</p>
<p>You need to tell the movie star that he has an eighth child, and that she is a hero.</p>
<h2>21</h2>
<p>The moon may appear to move, but really it is you who are moving.</p>
<p>At high velocity, a speedboat slams along the tops of waves.</p>
<p>Fear and excitement are sometimes indistinguishable.</p>
<p>When the captain of a boat adjusts his course in response to commands from your Designated Mate, he may not know where he is taking you.</p>
<p>If your Designated Mate keeps looking up, he&#8217;s probably using the stars for navigation.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean is vast enough to have once seemed infinite.</p>
<p>A beauty should require no more context than the presence of her Designated Mate. </p>
<p>A beauty must appear to enjoy any journey he initiates.</p>
<p>Simulate said enjoyment by putting an affectionate arm around him and nestling your head close to his.</p>
<p>A beauty whose head is aligned with her Designated Mate&#8217;s can share in his navigation and thus calculate the route.</p>
<p>At night, far from shore, stars pulse with a strength that is impossible to conceive of in the proximity of light.</p>
<p>Your whereabouts will never be a mystery; you will be visible at all times as a dot of light on the screens of those watching over you. </p>
<p>You are one of hundreds, each a potential hero.</p>
<p>Technology has afforded ordinary people a chance to glow in the cosmos of human achievement.</p>
<p>Your lack of espionage and language training is what makes your record clean and neutral.</p>
<p>You are an ordinary person undertaking an extraordinary task.</p>
<p>You need not be remarkable for your credentials or skill sets, only for your bravery and equilibrium.</p>
<p>Knowing that you are one of hundreds shouldn&#8217;t feel belittling.</p>
<p>In the new heroism, the goal is to merge with something larger than yourself.</p>
<p>In the new heroism, the goal is to throw off generations of self-involvement.</p>
<p>In the new heroism, the goal is to renounce the American fixation with being seen and recognized.</p>
<p>In the new heroism, the goal is to dig beneath your shiny persona.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be surprised by what lies under it: a rich, deep crawl space of possibilities.</p>
<p>Some liken this discovery to a dream in which a familiar home acquires new wings and rooms.</p>
<p>The power of individual magnetism is nothing against the power of combined selfless effort.</p>
<p>You may accomplish astonishing personal feats, but citizen agents rarely seek individual credit.</p>
<p>They liken the need for personal glory to cigarette addiction: a habit that feels life-sustaining even as it kills you.</p>
<p>Childish attention-seeking is usually satisfied at the expense of real power.</p>
<p>An enemy of the state could not have connived a better way to declaw and distract us.</p>
<p>Now our notorious narcissism is our camouflage.</p>
<h2>22</h2>
<p>After a juddering ride of several hours, you may not notice at first that the boat is approaching a shore.</p>
<p>A single lighted structure stands out strongly on a deserted coastline.</p>
<p>Silence after a roaring motor is a sound of its own.</p>
<p>The speedboat&#8217;s immediate departure signals that you won&#8217;t be making a return trip anytime soon.</p>
<p>Knowing your latitude and longitude is not the same as knowing where you are.</p>
<p>A new remote and unfamiliar place can make the prior remote and unfamiliar place seem like home.</p>
<p>Imagining yourself as a dot of light on a screen is oddly reassuring.</p>
<p>Because your husband is a visionary in the realm of national security, he occasionally has access to that screen.</p>
<p>If it calms you to imagine your husband tracking your dot of light, then imagine it.</p>
<p>Do not, however, close your eyes while ascending a rocky path in darkness.</p>
<p>At Latitude X, Longitude Y, the flora is dry and crumbles under your feet.</p>
<p>A voice overhead suggests that your arrival was expected and observed.</p>
<p>An empty shore is not necessarily unpatrolled.</p>
<p>The best patrols are imperceptible. </p>
<h2>23</h2>
<p>A formal handshake between your new host and your Designated Mate implies that this is their first meeting.</p>
<p>A formal handshake followed by a complex and stylized hand gesture implies a shared allegiance.</p>
<p>So does the immediate use of a language you don&#8217;t recognize.</p>
<p>In certain rich, powerful men, physical slightness will seem a source of strength.</p>
<p>The failure of your new host to acknowledge you may indicate that women do not register in his field of vision.</p>
<p>Being invisible means that you won&#8217;t be closely watched.</p>
<p>Your job is to be forgotten yet still present.</p>
<p>A white, sparkling villa amid so much scrabbly darkness will appear miragelike.</p>
<p>A man to whom women are invisible may still have many beauties in his domain.</p>
<p>These neglected beauties will vie for his scant attention.</p>
<p>Among neglected beauties, there is often an alpha beauty who assumes leadership.</p>
<p>As you enter the house, her cool scrutiny will ripple through the other beauties and surround you.</p>
<p>The sensation will remind you of going as a child with your mother to visit families with two parents and multiple children.</p>
<p>At first, the knot of unfamiliar kids would seem impenetrable.</p>
<p>You would wish, keenly, that you had a sibling who could be your ally.</p>
<p>Feeling at the mercy of those around you prompted a seismic internal response.</p>
<p>The will to dominate was deeper than yourself.</p>
<p>You were never childish, even as a child.</p>
<p>Your unchildishness is something your husband has always loved in you.</p>
<p>Once the new children were under your control, it was crushing to leave their midst.</p>
<h2>24</h2>
<p>A small table and chairs carved into a spindly clifftop promontory are doubtless designed for private conversation.</p>
<p>If your Designated Mate brings you with him to this place, it may mean that he feels less than perfectly at ease with your new host.</p>
<p>When your new host dismisses his own alpha beauty, important business may be under way.</p>
<p>An alpha beauty will not tolerate her own exclusion if another beauty is included.</p>
<p>If your new host makes a motion of dismissal at you, look to your Designated Mate.</p>
<p>Take orders from no one but your Designated Mate.</p>
<p>If your Designated Mate keeps an arm around you in the face of your new host&#8217;s dismissal, you have become the object of a power play.</p>
<p>If your new host moves close to your face and speaks directly into it, he is likely testing your ignorance of his language.</p>
<p>If your Designated Mate stiffens beside you, your new host&#8217;s words are probably offensive.</p>
<p>When you become an object of contention, try to neutralize the conflict.</p>
<p>A giggle and a look of incomprehension are a beauty&#8217;s most reliable tools.</p>
<p>If the men relax into their chairs, neutralization has been successful.</p>
<p>Your new host has insulted you and, by extension, your Designated Mate.</p>
<p>Your Designated Mate has prevailed in his claim that you&#8217;re too harmless to bother sending away.</p>
<p>Congratulate yourself on preserving your adjacency and activate your ear mike.</p>
<h2>25</h2>
<p>In the presence of business conversation, project an utter lack of interest or curiosity.</p>
<p>Notice where you are at all times.</p>
<p>On a high, narrow promontory at Latitude X, Longitude Y, the ocean and heavens shimmer in all directions.</p>
<p>There will be moments in your mission, perhaps very few, when you&#8217;ll sense the imminence of critical information. </p>
<p>It may come in the form of a rush of joy.</p>
<p>This joy may arise from your discovery that the moon, hard and radiant, is still aloft.</p>
<p>It may arise from the knowledge that, when your task is complete, you will return to the husband you adore.</p>
<p>It may arise from the extremity of the natural beauty around you, and the recognition that you are alive in this moment. </p>
<p>It may arise from your knowledge that you have accomplished every goal you&#8217;ve set for yourself since childhood.</p>
<p>It may arise from the knowledge that at long last you&#8217;ve found a goal worthy of your considerable energies.</p>
<p>It may arise from the knowledge that, by accomplishing this goal, you&#8217;ll have helped to perpetuate American life as you know it.</p>
<p>A wave of joy can make it difficult to sit still.</p>
<p>Beware of internal states&#8212;positive or negative&#8212;that obscure what is happening around you.</p>
<p>When two subjects begin making sketches, concrete planning may have commenced.</p>
<p>The camera implanted in your left eye is operated by pressing your left tear duct.</p>
<p>In poor light, a flash may be activated by pressing the outside tip of your left eyebrow.</p>
<p>When using the flash, always cover your non-camera eye to shield it from temporary blindness occasioned by the flash.</p>
<p>Never deploy flash photography in the presence of other people.</p>
<h2>26</h2>
<p>Springing from your seat with a gasp and peering toward the house will focus the attention of others in that direction.</p>
<p>Having heard something inaudible to others puts you in an immediate position of authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? What did you hear?,&#8221; uttered close to your face by your Designated Mate, means that your diversion was successful.</p>
<p>Wait until their eagerness to know verges on anger, evidenced by the shaking of your shoulders.</p>
<p>Then tell them, faintly, &#8220;I heard screaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Men with a history of violence live in fear of retribution.</p>
<p>Your new host will be the first to depart in the direction of alleged screaming.</p>
<p>Your Designated Mate&#8217;s glance toward the dock, far below, may reveal that his interests are not fully aligned with your new host&#8217;s. </p>
<p>His attention to his handset may portend that your diversion has run amok, undermining the transaction you meant to capture. </p>
<p>Among the violent, there is always a plan for escape.</p>
<h2>27</h2>
<p>It is reasonable to hope that a backlit screen will distract its user from a camera flash at some slight distance.</p>
<p>Move close to the sketches you wish to photograph, allowing them to fill your field of vision.</p>
<p>Hold very still.</p>
<p>A flash is far more dramatic in total darkness.</p>
<p>An epithet in another language, followed by &#8220;What the fuck was that?,&#8221; means you overestimated your Designated Mate&#8217;s handset absorption.</p>
<p>A bright, throbbing total blindness means that you neglected to cover your non-camera eye.</p>
<p>Distance yourself from agency in the flash by crying out, truthfully, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see!&#8221; </p>
<p>It is hard to safely navigate a clifftop promontory at high speed while blind.</p>
<p>It is hard to defer said navigation when your Designated Mate is forcefully yanking your hand.</p>
<p>A distant buzz presages an approaching speedboat.</p>
<p>Cooler air and a downward slope indicate that you are now below the cliff&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>Trying to negotiate a crumbling wooded path in a state of blindness (and heels) will soon lead to tripping and collapsing. </p>
<p>Receding downhill footfalls indicate that you&#8217;ve overtaxed your limited value to your Designated Mate.</p>
<p>A sense of helpless disorientation may prevent you from doing much more than sitting there in the dirt.</p>
<h2>28</h2>
<p>Variegation in the textures around you is a first sign that your temporary blindness has begun to fade.</p>
<p>Temporary blindness sharpens one&#8217;s appreciation for not being blind.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of blindness, the accretion of objects around you may have an almost sensual quality.</p>
<p>A boat departing at high speed will send a vibration trembling up through the soil.</p>
<p>The knowledge that you are alone, without your Designated Mate, will settle upon you slowly and coldly.</p>
<p>Each new phase of aloneness reveals that you were previously less alone than you thought.</p>
<p>This more profound isolation may register, at first, as paralysis.</p>
<p>If it soothes you to lie back in the dirt, then lie back.</p>
<p>The moon shines everywhere.</p>
<p>The moon can seem as expressive as a face.</p>
<p>Human beings are fiercely, primordially resilient.</p>
<p>In uneasy times, draw on the resilience you carry inside you.</p>
<p>Recall that the mythical feats you loved to read about as a child are puny beside the accomplishments of human beings on earth.</p>
<h2>29</h2>
<p>The presence of another person can be sensed, even when not directly perceived.</p>
<p>The discovery of another person at close range, when you thought you were alone, may occasion fear.</p>
<p>Leaping from a supine into a standing posture will induce a head rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you. Come out&#8221; must be uttered calmly, from the Readiness Position.</p>
<p>If you show fear, make sure that it isn&#8217;t the fear you actually feel.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve expected a man, the appearance of a woman may be shocking.</p>
<p>Despite all that you know and are, you may experience that shock as a relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you here?,&#8221; uttered by your new host&#8217;s alpha beauty, is likely hostile.</p>
<p>Respond to abstract questions on the most literal level: &#8220;He left without me.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Bastard,&#8221; muttered bitterly, suggests familiarity with the phenomenon of being left behind.</p>
<p>Sympathy from an unexpected source can prompt a swell of emotion.</p>
<p>Measure the potential liability of shedding tears before you let them fall.</p>
<p>The perfumed arm of a beauty may pour strength and hope directly into your skin.</p>
<h2>30</h2>
<p>A lavish clifftop villa may look even more miragelike on a second approach.</p>
<p>Sustaining an atmosphere of luxury in a remote place requires an enormous amount of money.</p>
<p>So does co&#246;rdinated violence.</p>
<p>Your job is to follow money to its source.</p>
<p>A powerful man whose associate has fled the premises after a false alarm is unlikely to be cheerful.</p>
<p>The reappearance of the vanished associate&#8217;s stranded beauty will likely startle him.</p>
<p>Astonishment is satisfying to witness on any face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the fuck did he go?&#8221; is remarkably easy to decipher, even in a language you don&#8217;t recognize.</p>
<p>A shrug is comprehensible to everyone.</p>
<p>An alpha beauty&#8217;s complete indifference to the consternation of her mate may mean that he&#8217;s easily moved to consternation.</p>
<p>It may also mean that he&#8217;s not her mate.</p>
<p>As a beauty, you will sometimes be expected to change hands.</p>
<p>Generally, you will pass from the hands of a less powerful man to those of a more powerful man.</p>
<p>Greater proximity to the source of money and control is progress.</p>
<p>Your job is identical regardless of whose hands you are in.</p>
<p>If your vulnerability and helplessness have drawn the interest of an enemy subject, accentuate them.</p>
<p>Scraped and dirty legs may accentuate your vulnerability to the point of disgust.</p>
<p>They might get you a hot shower, though.</p>
<h2>31</h2>
<p>Homes of the violent rich have excellent first-aid cabinets.</p>
<p>If, after tending to your scrapes, you are shown to a bathing area with a stone-encrusted waterfall, assume you won&#8217;t be alone for long.</p>
<p>The fact that a man has ignored and then insulted you does not mean that he won&#8217;t want to fuck you.</p>
<p>Slim, powerful men often move with catlike swiftness. </p>
<p>Begin your countdown early&#8212;as he lowers himself into the tub.</p>
<p>By the time he seizes your arm, you should be at five.</p>
<p>By the time your forehead is jammed against a rock, you should perceive your body only vaguely, from above.</p>
<h2>32</h2>
<p>If you feel, on returning to your body, that much time has passed, don&#8217;t dwell on how much.</p>
<p>If your limbs are sore and your forehead scraped and raw, don&#8217;t dwell on why.</p>
<p>When you emerge from a warm, churning bath where you&#8217;ve spent an indeterminate period of time, expect to feel shaky and weak.</p>
<p>Remind yourself that you are receiving no payment, in currency or kind, for this or any act you have engaged in.</p>
<p>These acts are forms of sacrifice.</p>
<p>An abundance of diaphanous bathrobes suggests that the occupants of this bathroom are often female.</p>
<p>A soiled and tattered white sundress can seem oddly precious when it&#8217;s all you have.</p>
<p>Keep with you the things that matter&#8212;you won&#8217;t come back for them later.</p>
<p>The stationing of a male attendant outside the bathroom means that you haven&#8217;t been forgotten.</p>
<p>If he shows you to a tiny room containing a very large bed, your utility to your new host may not have been exhausted.</p>
<p>A tray containing a meat pie, grapes, and a pitcher of water suggests that visits such as yours are routine.</p>
<p>At times, you may wish to avoid the moon.</p>
<p>At times, the moon may appear like a surveillance device, tracking your movements.</p>
<p>The ability to sleep in stressful conditions is essential to this work.</p>
<p>Sleep whenever you can safely do so.</p>
<h2>33</h2>
<p>Your abrupt awakening may feel like a reaction to a sound.</p>
<p>In moments of extreme solitude, you may believe you&#8217;ve heard your name.</p>
<p>We reassure ourselves by summoning, in our dreams, those we love and miss.</p>
<p>Having awakened to find them absent, we may be left with a sense of having spoken with them.</p>
<p>Even the most secure houses achieve, in deep night, a state of relative unconsciousness.</p>
<p>A beauty in a diaphanous lavender bathrobe can go anywhere, as long as she appears to be delivering herself to someone.</p>
<h2>34</h2>
<p>A universal principle of home construction makes it possible to guess which door will lead to the master bedroom.</p>
<p>Linen closets, with doors closed, can resemble master bedrooms.</p>
<p>So can bathrooms.</p>
<p>Bare feet are virtually soundless on a stone floor.</p>
<p>Even a slim, catlike man may snore.</p>
<p>When trespassing in a sleeping man&#8217;s bedroom, go straight to his bed, as if you were seeking him out.</p>
<p>An alpha beauty who has appeared to have no tie to your new host may turn out to be his intimate, after all.</p>
<p>Their sleeping entanglement may contradict everything you have witnessed between them.</p>
<p>A small crib near the bed may indicate the presence of a baby.</p>
<p>Avoid indulging your own amazement; it wastes time.</p>
<p>Master bedrooms in lavish homes often divide into &#8220;his&#8221; and &#8220;hers&#8221; areas.</p>
<p>A beauty&#8217;s closet is unmistakable, like a quiver of bright arrows.</p>
<p>The closet of a slight, catlike man will usually be compact.</p>
<p>Having penetrated a man&#8217;s personal space, immediately seek out his Sweet Spot.</p>
<p>The Sweet Spot is where he empties his pockets at the end of the day and stores the essentials he needs to begin the next.</p>
<p>The Sweet Spot of a secretive, catlike man will most often be inside a cupboard or a drawer. </p>
<p>When you find it, consider using a Data Surge to capture the contents of his handset.</p>
<p>A Data Surge must be deployed with extreme caution, and only if you feel confident of an exceptional yield.</p>
<p>The quantity of information captured will require an enormous amount of manpower to tease apart.</p>
<p>Its transmission will register on any monitoring device. </p>
<p>We can guarantee its effectiveness only once.</p>
<h2>35</h2>
<p>Reach between your right fourth and pinky toes (if right-handed) and remove the Data Plug from your Universal Port.</p>
<p>Attached to the plug is a cable with a connection pin at one end for insertion into the handset&#8217;s data port.</p>
<p>Sit on the floor, away from sharp surfaces, and brace your back against a wall.</p>
<p>A red ribbon has been tucked inside your Universal Port; enclose this in one of your palms. </p>
<p>Spread apart your toes and gently reinsert the plug, now fused to your subject&#8217;s handset, into your Universal Port. </p>
<p>You will feel the surge as the data flood your body.</p>
<p>The surge may contain feeling, memory, heat, cold, longing, pain, even joy.</p>
<p>Although the data are alien, the memories dislodged will be your own:</p>
<p>Peeling an orange for your husband in bed on a Sunday, sunlight splashing the sheets;</p>
<p>The smoky earthen smell of the fur of your childhood cat;</p>
<p>The flavor of the peppermints your mother kept for you inside her desk.</p>
<p>The impact of a Data Surge may prompt unconsciousness or short-term memory loss.</p>
<p>The purpose of the red ribbon is to orient you; if you awaken to find yourself clutching one, look to your foot.</p>
<p>When your body is quiet, unplug the handset and return it to its original location.</p>
<h2>36</h2>
<p>A Data Surge leaves a ringing in your ears that may obscure the sound of another person&#8217;s arrival.</p>
<p>A face that brought you relief once may trigger relief a second time.</p>
<p>When an alpha beauty accosts you at high volume in an unfamiliar language, it may mean she&#8217;s too sleepy to remember who you are.</p>
<p>It may also mean she&#8217;s calling someone else.</p>
<p>Beauty status will not excuse, for another beauty, your appearance where you are not supposed to be.</p>
<p>Should you be perceived as an enemy, prepare to defend yourself at the first sign of physical encroachment.</p>
<p>Your new host lunging at you, shouting, &#8220;What the fuck are you doing?,&#8221; constitutes physical encroachment.</p>
<p>Thrust your elbow upward into the tender socket underneath his jaw, sending him backward onto the floor.</p>
<p>The wails of a newborn will lure its mother away from almost anything, including the physical travails of her mate.</p>
<p>A man disabled by an elbow blow will have little reaction to infant cries.</p>
<h2>37</h2>
<p>At the revelation of martial-arts expertise, a man who has perceived you as merely a beauty will recalculate your identity and purpose.</p>
<p>Watch his eyes: he&#8217;ll be measuring the distance to his nearest firearm.</p>
<p>An immediate exit is advisable.</p>
<p>A slim, catlike man may well rebound before a hasty exit can be made.</p>
<p>Obstructing the path of a violent man to his firearm will nearly always result in another encroachment.</p>
<p>Kicking him in the foreneck, even barefoot, will temporarily occlude his windpipe. </p>
<p>The alpha beauty of a violent man will know where his firearm is kept, and how to use it.</p>
<p>A woman holding a gun and a baby no longer qualifies as a beauty.</p>
<p>No beauty is really a beauty.</p>
<p>Disabling a gun holder is likely to hurt the baby she is holding, too.</p>
<p>When self-preservation requires that you harm the innocent, we can provide no more than guidelines.</p>
<p>As Americans, we value human rights above all else and cannot sanction their violation.</p>
<p>When someone threatens <em>our</em> human rights, however, a wider leeway becomes necessary.</p>
<p>Follow your instincts while bearing in mind that we must, and will, hew to our principles.</p>
<p>A woman holding a thrashing baby in one arm may have trouble aiming a firearm with the other.</p>
<p>Bullets do actually whistle in an enclosed space.</p>
<p>If a person has shot at you and missed, incapacitate her before she can fire again. </p>
<p>We are most reluctant to hurt those who remind us of ourselves.</p>
<h2>38</h2>
<p>A lag time exists between getting shot and knowing that you have been shot.</p>
<p>Assuming there is no artery involvement, wounds to the upper limbs are preferable.</p>
<p>Bony, tendony body parts bleed less, but are harder to reconstruct if shattered.</p>
<p>The right shoulder is a bony, tendony part.</p>
<p>When shots have been fired in a powerful man&#8217;s home, you have minutes, if not seconds, before the arrival of security.</p>
<p>Your physical person is our Black Box; without it, we have no record of what has happened on your mission.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you remove yourself from enemy possession.</p>
<p>When you find yourself cornered and outnumbered, you may unleash, as a last resort, your Primal Roar. </p>
<p>The Primal Roar is the human equivalent of an explosion, a sound that combines screaming, shrieking, and howling.</p>
<p>The Roar must be accompanied by facial contortions and frenetic body movement, suggesting a feral, unhinged state.</p>
<p>The Primal Roar must transform you from a beauty into a monster.</p>
<p>The goal is to horrify your opponent, the way trusted figures, turned evil, are horrifying in movies and in nightmares.</p>
<p>Deploy your camera flash repeatedly while Roaring.</p>
<p>When approached by a howling, spasmodic, flashing monster, most women holding newborns will step aside. </p>
<p>Discontinue Roaring the instant you&#8217;re free from immediate danger.</p>
<p>Those stampeding to the aid of a powerful man will barely notice a dishevelled beauty they pass in a hallway. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, this will buy you time to flee his house.</p>
<p>Resume your beauty role while running: smooth your hair and cover your bleeding wound with the sundress scrunched in your pocket.</p>
<p>The fact that you can&#8217;t hear alarms doesn&#8217;t mean you haven&#8217;t set them off.</p>
<h2>39</h2>
<p>After violence in a closed room, cool night air will have a clarifying effect.</p>
<p>Get to the bottom of a hill any way you can, including sliding and rolling. </p>
<p>In residences of the violent rich, there will be at least one guard at each port of egress.</p>
<p>In deep night, if you are extremely lucky (and quiet), that guard will be asleep.</p>
<p>Assume, as well as you can, the air of a beauty larkishly gambolling.</p>
<p>If running barefoot onto a dock transports you back to your childhood, pain may be making you hallucinate.</p>
<p>Lying with girlfriends on a still-warm dock in upstate New York, watching shooting stars, is a sensation you remember after many years.</p>
<p>Hindsight creates the illusion that your life has led you inevitably to the present moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to believe in a foregone conclusion than to accept that our lives are governed by chance.</p>
<p>Showing up for a robotics course by accident, because of a classroom mixup, is chance.</p>
<p>Finding an empty seat beside a boy with very dark skin and beautiful hands is chance.</p>
<p>When someone has become essential to you, you will marvel that you could have lain on a warm dock and not have known him yet.</p>
<p>Expect reimmersion in your old life to be difficult.</p>
<p>Experience leaves a mark, regardless of the reasons and principles behind it.</p>
<p>What our citizen agents most often require is simply for time to pass.</p>
<p>Our counsellors are available around the clock for the first two weeks of your reimmersion and during business hours thereafter.</p>
<p>We ask that you allow our Therapeutic Agents, rather than those in the general population, to address your needs.</p>
<p>Secrecy is the basis of what we do, and we require your extreme discretion.</p>
<h2>40</h2>
<p>Even preternatural swimming strength cannot propel you across a blue-black sea.</p>
<p>Staring with yearning ferocity from the end of a dock cannot propel you across a blue-black sea.</p>
<p>When your body has been granted exceptional powers, it is jarring to encounter a gulf between your desires and your abilities. </p>
<p>For millennia, engineers have empowered human beings to accomplish mythical feats.</p>
<p>Your husband is an engineer.</p>
<p>Children raised among wild animals learn to detect irregular movements in their landscape.</p>
<p>That particular awareness, coupled with scientific genius, has made your husband a national-security hero.</p>
<p>Intimacy with another human can allow you to scrutinize your surroundings as he would.</p>
<p>Along a rocky, moonlit shore, the irregular movement is the one that is lurching in time with the water beneath an overhang of brush.</p>
<p>A speedboat has most likely been hidden by your new host as a means of emergency escape.</p>
<p>The key will be inside it.</p>
<h2>41</h2>
<p>Slither between branches and board the boat; untie it and lower its motor into the water.</p>
<p>Be grateful for the lakes in upstate New York where you learned to pilot motorboats.</p>
<p>Fluff up your hair with your functional arm and essay a wide, carefree smile.</p>
<p>A smile is like a shield; it freezes your face into a mask of muscle that you can hide behind. </p>
<p>A smile is like a door that is both open and closed.</p>
<p>Turn the key and gun the motor once before aiming into the blue-black sea and jamming the accelerator.</p>
<p>Wave and giggle loudly at the stunned, sleepy guard.</p>
<p>Steer in a zigzag motion until you are out of gunshot range.</p>
<h2>42</h2>
<p>The exultation of escape will be followed almost immediately by a crushing onslaught of pain.</p>
<p>The house, its occupants, even the gunshots will seem like phantoms beside this clanging immediacy.</p>
<p>If the pain makes thought impossible, concentrate solely on navigation.</p>
<p>Only in specific Geographic Hotspots can we intervene.</p>
<p>While navigating toward a Hotspot, indicate an emergency by pressing the button behind your knee for sixty continuous seconds.</p>
<p>You must remain conscious.</p>
<p>If it helps, imagine yourself in the arms of your husband.</p>
<p>If it helps, imagine yourself in your apartment, where his grandfather&#8217;s hunting knife is displayed inside a Plexiglas box.</p>
<p>If it helps, imagine harvesting the small tomatoes you grow on your fire escape in summer.</p>
<p>If it helps, imagine that the contents of the Data Surge will help thwart an attack in which thousands of American lives would have been lost.</p>
<p>Even without enhancements, you can pilot a boat in a semi-conscious state.</p>
<p>Human beings are superhuman.</p>
<p>Let the moon and the stars direct you.</p>
<h2>43</h2>
<p>When you reach the approximate location of a Hotspot, cut the engine.</p>
<p>You will be in total darkness, in total silence.</p>
<p>If you wish, you may lie down at the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>The fact that you feel like you&#8217;re dying doesn&#8217;t mean that you will die.</p>
<p>Remember that, should you die, your body will yield a crucial trove of information.</p>
<p>Remember that, should you die, your Field Instructions will provide a record of your mission and lessons for those who follow. </p>
<p>Remember that, should you die, you will have triumphed merely by delivering your physical person into our hands.</p>
<p>The boat&#8217;s movement on the sea will remind you of a cradle.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll recall your mother rocking you in her arms when you were a baby.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll recall that she has always loved you fiercely and entirely.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll discover that you have forgiven her.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll understand that she concealed your paternity out of faith that her own inexhaustible love would be enough.</p>
<p>The wish to tell your mother that you forgive her is yet another reason you must make it home alive.</p>
<p>You will not be able to wait, but you will have to wait.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t tell you in advance what direction relief will come from.</p>
<p>We can only reassure you that we have never yet failed to recover a citizen agent, dead or alive, who managed to reach a Hotspot.</p>
<h2>44</h2>
<p>Hotspots are not hot.</p>
<p>Even a warm night turns frigid at the bottom of a wet boat.</p>
<p>The stars are always there, scattered and blinking.</p>
<p>Looking up at the sky from below can feel like floating, suspended, and looking down.</p>
<p>The universe will seem to hang beneath you in its milky glittering mystery.</p>
<p>Only when you notice a woman like yourself, crumpled and bleeding at the bottom of a boat, will you realize what has happened.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve deployed the Dissociation Technique without meaning to.</p>
<p>There is no harm in this.</p>
<p>Released from pain, you can waft free in the night sky.</p>
<p>Released from pain, you can enact the fantasy of flying that you nurtured as a child.</p>
<p>Keep your body in view at all times; if your mind loses track of your body, it may be hard&#8212;even impossible&#8212;to reunite the two.</p>
<p>As you waft free in the night sky, you may notice a steady rhythmic churning in the gusting wind.</p>
<p>Helicopter noise is inherently menacing.</p>
<p>A helicopter without lights is like a mixture of bat, bird, and monstrous insect.</p>
<p>Resist the urge to flee this apparition; it has come to save you.</p>
<h2>45</h2>
<p>Know that in returning to your body you are consenting to be racked, once again, by physical pain.</p>
<p>Know that in returning to your body you are consenting to undertake a jarring reimmersion into an altered life.</p>
<p>Some citizen agents have chosen not to return.</p>
<p>They have left their bodies behind, and now they shimmer sublimely in the heavens.</p>
<p>In the new heroism, the goal is to transcend individual life, with its petty pains and loves, in favor of the dazzling collective.</p>
<p>You may picture the pulsing stars as the heroic spirits of former agent beauties.</p>
<p>You may imagine Heaven as a vast screen crowded with their dots of light.</p>
<h2>46</h2>
<p>If you wish to return to your body, it is essential that you reach it before the helicopter does.</p>
<p>If it helps, count backward.</p>
<p>By eight, you should be close enough to see your bare and dirty feet.</p>
<p>By five, you should be close enough to see the bloody dress wrapped around your shoulder.</p>
<p>By three, you should be close enough to see the dimples you were praised for as a child.</p>
<p>By two, you should hear the shallow bleating of your breath. </p>
<h2>47</h2>
<p>Having returned to your body, witness the chopper&#8217;s slow, throbbing descent.</p>
<p>It may appear to be the instrument of a purely mechanical realm.</p>
<p>It may look as if it had come to wipe you out.</p>
<p>It may be hard to believe that there are human beings inside it.</p>
