<h1>I. BEFORE THE WAR</h1>

<h2>GET BACK TO HAPPINESS</h2>
<p>When the destruction of Israel commenced, Isaac Bloch was weighing whether to kill
himself or move to the Jewish Home. He had lived in an apartment with books
touching the ceilings, and rugs thick enough to hide dice; then in a room and a
half with dirt floors; on forest floors, under unconcerned stars; under the
floorboards of a Christian who, half a world and three-quarters of a century
away, would have a tree planted to commemorate his righteousness; in a hole for
so many days his knees would never wholly unbend; among Gypsies and partisans
and half-decent Poles; in transit, refugee, and displaced persons camps; on a
boat with a bottle with a boat that an insomniac agnostic had miraculously
constructed inside it; on the other side of an ocean he would never wholly
cross; above half a dozen grocery stores he killed himself fixing up and
selling for small profits; beside a woman who rechecked the locks until she
broke them, and died of old age at forty-two without a syllable of praise in
her throat but the cells of her murdered mother still dividing in her brain;
and finally, for the last quarter century, in a snow-globe-quiet Silver Spring
split-level: ten pounds of Roman Vishniac bleaching on the coffee table;
Enemies, A Love Story demagnetizing in the world’s last functional VCR; egg
salad becoming bird flu in a refrigerator mummified with photographs of
gorgeous, genius, tumorless great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>German horticulturalists had pruned Isaac’s family tree all the way back to the
Galician soil. But with luck and intuition and no help from above, he had
transplanted its roots into the sidewalks of Washington, D.C., and lived to see
it regrow limbs. And unless America turned on the Jews—until, his son, Irv,
would correct—the tree would continue to branch and sprout. Of course, Isaac
would be back in a hole by then. He would never unbend his knees, but at his
unknown age, with unknown indignities however near, it was time to unball his
Jewish fists and concede the beginning of the end. The difference between
conceding and accepting is depression.</p>

<p>Even putting aside the destruction of Israel, the timing was unfortunate: it was
only weeks before his eldest great-grandson’s bar mitzvah, which Isaac had been
marking as his life’s finish line ever since he crossed the previous finish
line of his youngest great-grandson’s birth. But one can’t control when an old
Jew’s soul will vacate his body and his body will vacate the coveted one-bedroom
for the next body on the waiting list. One can’t rush or defer manhood, either.
Then again, the purchase of a dozen nonrefundable airplane tickets, the booking
of a block of the Washington Hilton, and the payment of twenty-three thousand
dollars in deposits for a bar mitzvah that has been on the calendar since the
last Winter Olympics are no guarantee that it’s going to happen.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>A
group of boys lumbered down the halls of Adas Israel, laughing, punching, blood
rushing from developing brains to developing genitals and back again in the
zero-sum game of puberty.</p>

<p>“Seriously,
though,” one said, the second s getting caught on his palate expander, “the
only good thing about blowjobs are the wet handjobs you get with them.”</p>

<p>“Amen
to that.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise
you’re just boning a glass of water with teeth.”</p>

<p>“Which
is pointless,” said a redheaded boy who still got chills from so much as
thinking about the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.</p>

<p>“Nihilistic.”</p>

<p>If
God existed and judged, He would have forgiven these boys everything, knowing
that they were compelled by forces outside of themselves inside of themselves,
and that they, too, were made in His image.</p>

<p>Silence
as they slowed to watch Margot Wasserman lapping water. It was said that her
parents parked two cars outside their three-car garage because they had five
cars. It was said that her Pomeranian still had its balls, and they were
honeydews.</p>

<p>“Goddamn
it, I want to be that drinking fountain,” a boy with the Hebrew name
Peretz-Yizchak said.</p>

<p>“I
want to be the missing part of those crotchless undies.”</p>

<p>“I
want to fill my dick with mercury.”</p>

<p>A
pause.</p>

<p>“What
the hell does that mean?”</p>

<p>“You
know,” Marty Cohen-Rosenbaum, né Chaim ben Kalman, said, “like … make my dick a
thermometer.”</p>

<p>“By
feeding it sushi?”</p>

<p>“Or
just injecting it. Or whatever. Dude, you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>Four
shakes, and their heads achieved an unintended synchronicity, like Ping-Pong
spectators.</p>

<p>In a
whisper: “To put it in her butt.”</p>

<p>The
others were lucky to have twenty-first-century moms who knew that temperatures
were taken digitally in the ear. And Chaim was lucky that the boys’ attention
was diverted before they had time to slap him with a nickname he would never
shed.</p>

<p>Sam
was sitting on the bench outside Rabbi Singer’s office, head lowered, eyes on
the upturned hands in his lap like a monk waiting to burn. The boys stopped,
turning their self-hatred toward him.</p>

<p>“We
heard what you wrote,” one said, thrusting a finger into Sam’s chest. “You
crossed a line.”</p>

<p>“Some
fucked-up shit, bro.”</p>

<p>It
was odd, because Sam’s profligate sweat production usually didn’t kick in until
the threat had subsided.</p>

<p>“I
didn’t write it, and I’m not your”—air quotes—“bro.”</p>

<p>He
could have said that, but he didn’t. He also could have explained why nothing
was as it seemed. But he didn’t. Instead, he just took it, as he always did in
life on the crap side of the screen.</p>

<p>On
the other side of the rabbi’s door, on the other side of the rabbi’s desk, sat
Sam’s parents, Jacob and Julia. They didn’t want to be there. No one wanted to
be there. The rabbi needed to embroider some thoughtful-sounding words about
someone named Ralph Kremberg before they put him in the ground at two o’clock.
Jacob would have preferred to be working on the bible for Ever-Dying People, or
ransacking the house for his missing phone, or at least tapping the Internet’s
lever for some dopamine hits. And today was supposed to be Julia’s day off—this
was the opposite of off.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t
Sam be in here?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“I
think it’s best if we have an adult conversation,” Rabbi Singer said.</p>

<p>“Sam’s
an adult.”</p>

<p>“Sam
is not an adult,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Because
he’s three verses shy of mastering the blessings after the blessings after his
haftorah?”</p>

<p>Ignoring Jacob, Julia put her hand on the rabbi’s desk and said,
“It’s clearly unacceptable to talk back to a teacher, and we want to find a way
to make this right.”</p>

<p>“But at the same time,” Jacob said, “isn’t suspension a bit
draconian for what, in the scheme of things, is not really that big a deal?”</p>

<p>“Jacob…”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>In an effort to communicate with her husband but not the rabbi,
Julia pressed two fingers to her brow and gently shook her head while flaring
her nostrils. She looked more like a third-base coach than a wife, mother, and
member of the community attempting to keep the ocean from her son’s sand
castle.</p>

<p>“Adas Israel is a progressive shul,” the rabbi said, eliciting
an eye-roll from Jacob as reflexive as gagging. “We have a long and proud
history of seeing beyond the cultural norms of any given moment, and finding
the divine light, the Ohr Ein Sof, in every person. Using racial epithets here
is a very big deal, indeed.”</p>

<p>“What?” Julia asked, finding her posture.</p>

<p>“That can’t be right,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>The rabbi sighed a rabbi’s sigh and slid a piece of paper across
his desk to Julia.</p>

<p>“He said these?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>“He wrote them.”</p>

<p>“Wrote what?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>Shaking her head in disbelief, Julia quietly read the list:
“Filthy Arab, chink, cunt, jap, faggot, spic, kike, n-word—”</p>

<p>“He wrote ‘n-word’?” Jacob asked. “Or the actual n-word?”</p>

<p>“The word itself,” the rabbi said.</p>

<p>Though his son’s plight should have taken mental precedence,
Jacob became distracted by the fact that this was the only word that could not
bear vocalization.</p>

<p>“There must be a misunderstanding,” Julia said, finally handing
the paper to Jacob. “Sam nurses animals back to—”</p>

<p>“Cincinnati Bow Tie? That’s not a racial epithet. It’s a sex
act. I think. Maybe.”</p>

<p>“They’re not all epithets,” the rabbi said.</p>

<p>“You know, I’m pretty sure ‘Filthy Arab’ is a sex act, too.”</p>

<p>“I would have to take your word for it.”</p>

<p>“My point is, maybe we’re completely misinterpreting this list.”</p>

<p>Ignoring her husband again, Julia said, “What has Sam said about
this?”</p>

<p>The rabbi picked at his beard, searching for words as a macaque
searches for lice.</p>

<p>“He denied it. Vociferously. But the words weren’t there before
class, and he is the only person who sits at that desk.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t do it,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“It’s his handwriting,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“All thirteen-year-old boys write the same.”</p>

<p>The rabbi said, “He wasn’t able to offer another explanation for
how it got there.”</p>

<p>“It’s not his job to,” Jacob said. “And by the way, if Sam were
to have written those words, why on earth would he have left them on the desk?
The brazenness proves his innocence. Like in Basic Instinct.”</p>

<p>“But she did it in Basic Instinct,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“She did?”</p>

<p>“The ice pick.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right. But that’s a movie. Obviously some
genuinely racist kid, with a grudge against Sam, planted it.”</p>

<p>Julia spoke directly to the rabbi: “We’ll make sure Sam
understands why what he wrote is so hurtful.”</p>

<p>“Julia,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Would an apology to the teacher be sufficient to get the bar
mitzvah back on its tracks?”</p>

<p>“It’s what I was going to suggest. But I’m afraid word of his
words has spread around our community. So—”</p>

<p>Jacob expelled a puff of frustration—a gesture he’d either
taught to Sam or learned from him. “And hurtful to whom, by the way? There’s a
world of difference between breaking someone’s nose and shadow boxing.”</p>

<p>The rabbi studied Jacob. He asked, “Has Sam been having any
difficulties at home?”</p>

<p>“He’s been overwhelmed by homework,” Julia began.</p>

<p>“He did not do this.”</p>

<p>“And he’s been training for his bar mitzvah, which is, at least
in theory, another hour every night. And cello, and soccer. And his younger
brother Max is going through some existential stuff, which has been challenging
for everyone. And the youngest, Benjy—”</p>

<p>“It sounds like he’s got a lot on his plate,” the rabbi said.
“And I certainly sympathize with that. We ask a lot of our children. More than
was ever asked of us. But I’m afraid racism has no place here.”</p>

<p>“Of course it doesn’t,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Hold on. Now you’re calling Sam a racist?”</p>

<p>“I did not say that, Mr. Bloch.”</p>

<p>“You did. You just did. Julia—”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember his exact words.”</p>

<p>“I said, ‘Racism has no place here.’”</p>

<p>“Racism is what racists express.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever lied, Mr. Bloch?” Jacob reflexively searched his
jacket pocket yet again for his phone. “I assume that, like everyone who has
ever lived, you have told a lie. But that doesn’t make you a liar.”</p>

<p>“You’re calling me a liar?” Jacob asked, his fingers wrapped
around nothing.</p>

<p>“You’re boxing at shadows, Mr. Bloch.”</p>

<p>Jacob turned to Julia. “Yes, the n-word is clearly bad. Bad,
bad, very bad. But it was one word among many.”</p>

<p>“You think the larger context of misogyny, homophobia, and
perversion makes it better?”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>The rabbi shifted in his chair. “If I can speak frankly for a
moment.” He paused, thumbing the inside of his nostril with plausible
deniability. “It can’t be easy for Sam—being Irving Bloch’s grandson.”</p>

<p>Julia leaned back and thought about sand castles, and the Shinto
shrine gate that washed up in Oregon two years after the tsunami.</p>

<p>Jacob turned to the rabbi. “Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“For a child’s role model—”</p>

<p>“This should be good.”</p>

<p>The rabbi addressed Julia. “You must know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“We do not know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps if it didn’t seem, to Sam, that saying anything, no
matter—”</p>

<p>“You’ve read volume two of Robert Caro’s biography of Lyndon
Johnson?”</p>

<p>“I have not.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you were the worldly kind of rabbi, and had read that
classic of the genre, you’d know that pages 432 to 435 are devoted to how
Irving Bloch did more than anyone else in Washington, or anywhere, to ensure
the passage of the Voting Rights Act. A kid could not find a better role
model.”</p>

<p>“A kid shouldn’t have to look,” Julia said, facing forward.</p>

<p>“Now … did my father blog something regrettable? Yes. He did. It
was regrettable. He regrets it. An all-you-can-eat buffet of regret. But for
you to suggest that his righteousness is anything but an inspiration to his
grandchildren—”</p>

<p>“With all due respect, Mr. Bloch—”</p>

<p>Jacob turned to Julia: “Let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p>“Let’s actually get what Sam needs.”</p>

<p>“Sam doesn’t need anything from this place. It was a mistake to
force him to have a bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“What? Jacob, we didn’t force him. We might have nudged him,
but—”</p>

<p>“We nudged him to get circumcised. With the bar mitzvah, it was
proper force.”</p>

<p>“For the last two years, your grandfather has been saying that
the only reason he hangs on is to make it to Sam’s bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason not to have it.”</p>

<p>“And we wanted Sam to know that he’s Jewish.”</p>

<p>“Was there any chance of him not knowing that?”</p>

<p>“To be Jewish.”</p>

<p>“Jewish, yes. But religious?”</p>

<p>Jacob never knew how to answer the question “Are you religious?”
He’d never not belonged to a synagogue, never not made some gesture toward
kashruth, never not assumed—not even in his moments of greatest frustration
with Israel, or his father, or American Jewry, or God’s absence—that he would
raise his children with some degree of Jewish literacy and practice. But double
negatives never sustained a religion. Or as Sam’s brother Max would put it in
his bar mitzvah speech three years later, “You only get to keep what you refuse
to let go of.” And as much as Jacob wanted the continuity (of history, culture,
thought, and values), as much as he wanted to believe that there was a deeper
meaning available not only to him but to his children and their children—light
shone between his fingers.</p>

<p>When they had started dating, Jacob and Julia often spoke about
a “religion for two.” It would have felt embarrassing if it hadn’t felt
ennobling. Their Shabbat: every Friday night, Jacob would read a letter he had
written for Julia over the course of the week, and she would recite a poem from
memory; and without overhead lighting, the phone unplugged, the watches stowed
under the cushion of the red corduroy armchair, they would slowly eat the
dinner they’d slowly prepared together; and they would draw a bath and make
love while the waterline rose. Wednesday sunrise strolls: the route became
unwittingly ritualized, traced and retraced week after week, until the sidewalk
bore an impression of their path—imperceptible, but there. Every Rosh Hashanah,
in lieu of going to services, they performed the ritual of tashlich: casting
breadcrumbs, meant to symbolize the past year’s regrets, into the Potomac. Some
sank, some were carried to other shores by the current, some regrets were taken
by gulls to feed their still-blind young. Every morning, before rising from the
bed, Jacob kissed Julia between the legs—not sexually (the ritual demanded that
the kiss never lead to anything), but religiously. They started to collect,
when traveling, things whose insides had an aspect of being larger than their
outsides: the ocean contained in a seashell, a depleted typewriter ribbon, the
world in a mercury-glass mirror. Everything seemed to move toward ritual—Jacob
picking Julia up from work on Thursdays, the morning coffee in shared silence,
Julia replacing Jacob’s bookmarks with small notes—until, like a universe that
has expanded to its limit and then contracts toward its beginning, everything
was undone.</p>

<p>Some Friday nights were just too late, and some Wednesday mornings
were just too early. After a difficult conversation there would be no kiss
between the legs, and if one isn’t feeling generous, how many things really
qualify as being larger on the inside than on the outside? (You can’t put
resentment on a shelf.) They held on to what they could, and tried not to
acknowledge how secular they had become. But every now and then, usually in a
moment of defensiveness that, despite the pleas of every better angel, simply
could not resist taking the form of blame, one of them would say, “I miss our
Shabbats.”</p>

<p>Sam’s birth felt like another chance, as did Max’s and Benjy’s.
A religion for three, for four, for five. They ritualistically marked the
children’s heights on the doorframe on the first day of every year—secular and
Jewish—always first thing in the morning, before gravity did its work of
compression. They threw resolutions into the fire every December 31, took Argus
on a family walk every Tuesday after dinner, and read report cards aloud on the
way to Vace for otherwise forbidden aranciatas and limonatas. Tuck-in happened
in a certain order, according to certain elaborate protocols, and on anyone’s
birthday everyone slept in the same bed. They often observed Shabbat—as much in
the sense of self-consciously witnessing religion as fulfilling it—with a Whole
Foods challah, Kedem grape juice, and the tapered wax of endangered bees in the
silver candleholders of extinct ancestors. After the blessings, and before
eating, Jacob and Julia would go to each of the children, hold his head, and
whisper into his ear something of which they were proud that week. The extreme
intimacy of the fingers in the hair, the love that wasn’t secret but had to be
whispered, sent tremors through the filaments of the dimmed bulbs.</p>

<p>After dinner, they performed a ritual whose origin no one could
remember and whose meaning no one questioned: they closed their eyes and walked
around their house. It was fine to speak, to be silly, to laugh, but their
blindness always became silent. Over time, they developed a tolerance for the
dark quiet and could last for ten minutes, then twenty. They would meet back at
the kitchen table, and then open their eyes together. Each time it was
revelatory. Two revelations: the foreignness of a home the children had lived in
their entire lives, and the foreignness of sight.</p>

<p>One Shabbat, as they drove to visit their great-grandfather
Isaac, Jacob said, “A person gets drunk at a party, and hits and kills a kid on
the way home. Another person gets equally drunk, and makes it home safely. Why
does the first one go to jail for the rest of his life, while the second gets
to wake up the next morning as if nothing happened?”</p>

<p>“Because he killed a kid.”</p>

<p>“But in terms of what they did wrong, they are equally guilty.”</p>

<p>“But the second one didn’t kill a kid.”</p>

<p>“Not because he was innocent, but because he was lucky.”</p>

<p>“But still, the first one killed a kid.”</p>

<p>“But when we think about guilt, shouldn’t we think about actions
and intentions, in addition to outcomes?”</p>

<p>“What kind of party was it?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, and what was the kid doing out that late, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I think the point—”</p>

<p>“His parents should have kept him safe. They should be sent to
jail. But I guess then the kid wouldn’t have parents. Unless he lived in jail
with them.”</p>

<p>“You’re forgetting he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, right.”</p>

<p>Sam and Max became enthralled by intention. Once, Max ran into
the kitchen crying, holding his stomach. “I punched him,” Sam said from the
living room, “but not on purpose.” Or when, in retaliation, Max stomped on
Sam’s half-finished Lego chalet and said, “It wasn’t on purpose; I only meant
to stomp on the rug beneath it.” Broccoli was fed to Argus under the table, “by
accident.” Quizzes weren’t studied for, “on purpose.” The first time Max told
Jacob “Shut up”—in response to a poorly timed suggestion that he take a break
from some Tetris derivative on which he was about to crack the top ten scores
of the day but wasn’t supposed to be playing in the first place—he put down
Jacob’s phone, ran to him, hugged him, and with fear-glazed eyes, said, “I
didn’t mean it.”</p>

<p>When the fingers of Sam’s left hand were crushed in the hinge of
the heavy iron door and he screamed, “Why did that happen?” over and over and
over, “Why did that happen?” and Julia, holding him against her, blood blooming
across her shirt as breast milk used to when she heard a baby cry, said simply,
“I love you, and I’m here,” and Jacob said, “We need to go to the emergency
room,” Sam, who feared doctors more than anything any doctor could ever treat,
pleaded, “We don’t! We don’t! It was on purpose! I did this on purpose!”</p>

<p>Time passed, the world exerted itself, and Jacob and Julia began
to forget to do things on purpose. They didn’t refuse to let go, and like the
resolutions, and Tuesday walks, and birthday calls to the cousins in Israel,
and three overflowing shopping bags of Jewish deli food brought to
Great-Grandpa Isaac on the first Sunday of every month, and skipping school for
the Nats’ home opener, and singing “Singin’ in the Rain” while riding Ed the
Hyena through the automated car wash, and the “gratitude journals,” and “ear
inspections,” and annual pumpkin picking and carving and seed roasting and
monthlong decomposition, the whispered pride fell away.</p>

<p>The inside of life became far smaller than the outside, creating
a cavity, an emptiness. Which is why the bar mitzvah felt so important: it was
the final thread of the frayed tether. To snip it, as Sam had so badly wanted,
and as Jacob was now suggesting against his own real need, would send not just
Sam but the family floating off into that emptiness—more than enough oxygen to
last a life, but what kind of life?</p>

<p>Julia turned to the rabbi: “If Sam apologizes—”</p>

<p>“For what?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“If he apologizes—”</p>

<p>“To whom?”</p>

<p>“Everyone,” the rabbi said.</p>

<p>“Everyone? Everyone living and dead?”</p>

<p>Jacob assembled that phrase—everyone living and dead—not in the
light of all that was about to happen, but in the pitch-blackness of the
moment: this was before the folded prayers bloomed from the Wailing Wall,
before the Japanese Crisis, before the ten thousand missing children and the
March of a Million, before “Adia” became the most searched term in the history
of the Internet. Before the devastating aftershocks, before the alignment of
nine armies and the distribution of iodine pills, before America never sent
F-16s, before the Messiah was too distracted or nonexistent to awake the living
or the dead. Sam was becoming a man. Isaac was weighing whether to kill himself
or move from a home to a Home.</p>

<p>“We want to put this behind us,” Julia said to the rabbi. “We
want to make it right, and go through with the bar mitzvah as planned.”</p>

<p>“By apologizing for everything to everyone?”</p>

<p>“We want to get back to happiness.”</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia silently registered the hope and sadness and
strangeness of what she’d said, as the word dissipated through the room and
settled atop the stacks of religious books and on the stained carpeting. They’d
lost their way, and lost their compass, but not their belief that it was
possible to get back—even if neither knew exactly what happiness she was
referring to.</p>

<p>The rabbi interwove his fingers, just like a rabbi, and said,
“There’s a Hasidic proverb: ‘While we pursue happiness, we flee from
contentment.’”</p>

<p>Jacob rose, folded the paper, tucked it in his pocket, and said,

<h2>HERE I AMN’T</h2>

<p>While Sam waited on the bench outside Rabbi Singer’s office,
Samanta approached the bimah. Sam had built it from digital old-growth elm
salvaged from the bottom of a digital freshwater lake that he’d dug and in
which he’d submerged a small forest a year ago when, like one of those innocent
dogs on one of those existence-of-evil electrified floors, he’d learned
helplessness.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter whether or not you want a bar mitzvah,” his
dad had said. “But try to think of that as inspiring.”</p>

<p>Why was he so obsessed with animal cruelty, anyway? Why was he
irrepressibly drawn to videos that he knew would only reinforce his convictions
about humankind? He spent enormous amounts of time seeking violence: animal
cruelty, but also animal fights (organized by humans, and in nature), animals
attacking people, bullfighters getting what they deserved, skateboarders
getting what they deserved, athletes’ knees bending the wrong way, bum fights,
helicopter beheadings, and more: garbage disposal accidents, car antenna
lobotomies, civilian victims of chemical warfare, masturbation injuries, Shia
heads on Sunni fence posts, botched surgeries, steam-burn victims,
instructional videos about cutting away the questionable parts of roadkill (as
if there were unquestionable parts), instructional videos about painless
suicide (as if that weren’t definitionally impossible), and so on, and on and
on. The images were sharp objects he used against himself: there was so much in
him that he needed to move to the outside, but the process required wounds.</p>

<p>On the silent drive home, he explored the chapel that he’d built
around the bimah: the three-toed claw feet of the weightless two-ton pews; the
Gordian-knotted fringes at the ends of the rag-rug runner down the aisle; the
prayer books, each word of which was continually refreshed with its synonym:
the Lord is One … the Sovereign is Alone … the Absolute is Abandoned … Left to
go long enough, the prayers would, if only for an instant, return to their
origins. But even if the average life expectancy continued to increase by one
year with each passing year, it would take forever for people to live forever,
so probably no one would ever see it.</p>

<p>The pressure of Sam’s unreleased insides often took the shape of
unshared, useless brilliance, and while his dad, brothers, and grandparents ate
lunch downstairs, while they were obviously talking about what he’d been
accused of and what to do with him, while he was supposed to be memorizing the
Hebrew words and Jewish melody of a haftorah whose meaning no one ever bothered
with, he created morphing stained-glass windows. The window to Samanta’s right
depicted baby Moses being swept down the Nile, between mothers. It was a loop,
but stitched together to evoke an endless journey.</p>

<p>Sam thought it would be cool if the chapel’s largest window were
an ongoing depiction of the Jewish Present, so instead of learning the idiotic
and utterly useless Ashrei, he wrote a script that pulled keywords from a
Jewish-related Google News feed, ran them through a jury-rigged video search
(which combed out redundancies, red herrings, and anti-Semitic propaganda), ran
those results through a jury-rigged video filter (which scaled the images to
best conform to the round frame and color-adjusted for continuity), and
projected them onto the window. It was better in his head than in reality, but
everything was.</p>

<p>Around the chapel he’d built the synagogue itself: the labyrinth
of literally infinitely forking hallways; the aranciata-dispensing water
fountains, and urinals made of the bones of ivory poachers; the stashes of
genuinely loving, nonmisogynistic face-sitting porn in the storage closet in
the Men’s Club social hall; the ironic handicapped spot in the stroller parking
lot; the Memorial Wall with tiny, never-working bulbs beside the names of those
upon whom he wished quick and painless death, but death (former best friends,
the people who made acne pads sting on purpose, etc.); various make-out
grottoes where tenderhearted and legitimately funny girls, who dressed like
American Apparel advertisements and wrote Percy Jackson fan fiction, allowed
klutzes to suck their perfect boobs; chalkboards that delivered 600-volt
electrical pulses when scratched by the fingernails of smart-ass, dumb-fuck
bullies who were so obviously—except to everyone besides Sam—fifteen short
years from being paunchy schmucks with tedious jobs and dumpy wives; small
plaques on every surface letting everyone know that it was because of Samanta’s
beneficence, her fundamental goodness, her love of mercy and fairness and the
benefit of the doubt, her decency, her inherent value, her nontoxic
unshittiness, that the ladder to the roof existed, that the roof existed, that
the perpetually buffering God existed.</p>

<p>The synagogue was originally at the edge of a community that had
developed around a shared love of videos in which guilty dogs express shame. He
could watch such videos all day—more than once he did—without going too deep
into what he found so appealing about them. The obvious explanation would be
that he empathized with the dog, and there was obviously some truth in that.
(“Did you do that, Sam? Did you write those words? Were you bad?”) But he was
also drawn to the owners. Every single one of the videos was made by someone
who loved his dog more than himself; the “shaming” was always funnily
overdramatized and good-spirited, and they all ended with reconciliation. (He’d
tried making his own such videos, but Argus was too old and tired to do
anything other than shit himself, for which no shaming could be good-spirited.)
So it had something to do with the sinner, and something with the judge, and
the fear of not being forgiven, and the relief of being loved again. Maybe in
his next life, his feelings would be less than all-consuming and some portion
of him would remain for understanding.</p>

<p>There was nothing exactly wrong with the original location, but
life was for good-enough, and Other Life was for putting things in the places
they longed to be. Sam secretly believed that everything was capable of
longing, and more, that everything was always longing. So after the
shame-inducing chew-out he got from his mom later that day, he paid some
digital movers some digital currency to disassemble the synagogue into the
largest parts that would fit into the largest trucks, move them, and reassemble
them according to screen grabs.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have to talk when Dad comes home from his
meeting, but I need to say something. It is required.”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>“Stop saying ‘fine.’”</p>

<p>“Sorry.”</p>

<p>“Stop saying ‘sorry.’”</p>

<p>“I thought the whole point was that I was supposed to be
apologizing?”</p>

<p>“For what you did.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t—”</p>

<p>“I’m very disappointed in you.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“That’s it? You don’t have anything else to say? Like maybe, ‘I
did it and I’m sorry’?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Clean up this mess. It’s disgusting.”</p>

<p>“It’s my room.”</p>

<p>“But it’s our house.”</p>

<p>“I can’t move that board. We’re only halfway done with the game.
Dad said we could finish after I’m not in trouble anymore.”</p>

<p>“You know why you always beat him?”</p>

<p>“Because he lets me win.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t let you win in years.”</p>

<p>“He goes easy.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t. You beat him because it excites him to capture
pieces, but you’re always thinking four moves ahead. It makes you good at
chess, and it makes you good at life.”</p>

<p>“I’m not good at life.”</p>

<p>“You are when you’re thoughtful.”</p>

<p>“Is Dad bad at life?”</p>

<p>It went almost perfectly, but movers are less almost-perfect
than the rest of humankind, and there were mishaps, hardly any of them
noticeable—who but Sam would know that a Jewish star was dinged and hung upside
down?—especially when hardly any of it was noticed in the first place. The tiny
distance from perfect rendered it shit.</p>

<p>Sam’s dad had given him an article about a boy in a
concentration camp who observed his bar mitzvah by digging an imaginary synagogue
and filling it with upright twigs to serve as a silent congregation. Of course,
his dad never would have guessed that Sam actually read it, and they never
spoke about it, and does it count as recalling something if you are thinking of
it constantly?</p>

<p>It was all for the occasion—the entire edifice of organized
religion conceived of, built, and tended to simply for a brief ritual. Despite
the incomprehensible vastness of Other Life, there was no synagogue. And
despite his profound reluctance ever to step foot in an actual synagogue, there
had to be a synagogue. He didn’t long for one, he needed one: you can’t destroy
what doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>HAPPINESS</h2>

<p>All happy mornings resemble one another, as do all unhappy
mornings, and that’s at the bottom of what makes them so deeply unhappy: the
feeling that this unhappiness has happened before, that efforts to avoid it
will at best reinforce it, and probably even exacerbate it, that the universe
is, for whatever inconceivable, unnecessary, and unjust reason, conspiring
against the innocent sequence of clothes, breakfast, teeth and egregious
cowlicks, backpacks, shoes, jackets, goodbye.</p>

<p>Jacob had insisted that Julia take her car to the meeting with
Rabbi Singer so she could leave straight from there and still get her day off.
The walk through the school to the parking lot was severely quiet. Sam had
never heard of Miranda rights, but he intuited them. Not that it mattered—his
parents didn’t want to talk in front of him before talking behind his back. So
they left him at the entrance, among the mustached man-children playing
Yu-Gi-Oh!, while they went to their cars.</p>

<p>“Did you want me to pick anything up?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Now.”</p>

<p>“You have to get home for brunch with your parents.”</p>

<p>“I’m just trying to take some load off your shoulders.”</p>

<p>“We could use sandwich bread.”</p>

<p>“Any particular kind?”</p>

<p>“The particular kind we always get.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“What what?”</p>

<p>“You seem bothered.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t bothered?”</p>

<p>Had she found the phone?</p>

<p>“We’re not going to talk about what just happened in there?”</p>

<p>She hadn’t found the phone.</p>

<p>“Of course we are,” he said. “But not in this parking lot. Not
with Sam waiting on the steps for us and my parents waiting at the house.”</p>

<p>“So when?”</p>

<p>“Tonight?”</p>

<p>“Tonight? With a question mark? Or, tonight.”</p>

<p>“Tonight.”</p>

<p>“You promise?”</p>

<p>“Julia.”</p>

<p>“And don’t just let him sulk in his room with his iPad. He
should know we’re upset.”</p>

<p>“He knows.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I want him to know even when I’m not there.”</p>

<p>“He’ll know.”</p>

<p>“You promise?” she asked, this time letting the question descend
rather than rise.</p>

<p>“Cross my heart and hope against hope to die.”</p>

<p>She could have said more—given examples from recent history, or
explained why it wasn’t the punishment she was worried about, but the
reinforcement of their nearly calcified and completely miscast parental
roles—but chose instead to offer a gentle, sustained squeeze of the arm.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Touch had always saved them in the past. No matter the anger or
hurt, no matter the depth of the aloneness, a touch, even a light and passing
touch, reminded them of their long togetherness. A palm on a neck: it all
flooded back. A head leaned upon a shoulder: the chemicals surged, the memory
of love. At times, it was almost impossible to cross the distance between their
bodies, to reach out. At times, it was impossible. Each knew the feeling so
well, in the silence of a darkened bedroom, looking at the same ceiling: If I
could open my fingers, my heart’s fingers could open. But I can’t. I want to
reach across the distance, and I want to be reached. But I can’t.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about this morning,” he said. “I wanted you to have
the whole day.”</p>

<p>“You’re not the one who wrote those words.”</p>

<p>“Neither is Sam.”</p>

<p>“Jacob.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“It cannot, it will not, be the case that one of us believes him
and one doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“So believe him.”</p>

<p>“He clearly did it.”</p>

<p>“Believe him anyway. We’re his parents.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. And we need to teach him that actions have
consequences.”</p>

<p>“Believing him is more important,” Jacob said, the conversation
happening too quickly for him to catch up to his own meaning. Why was he
choosing this battle?</p>

<p>“No,” Julia said, “loving him is more important. And on the
other side of punishment, he’ll know that our love, which requires causing him
pain every now and then, is the ultimate consequence.”</p>

<p>Jacob opened Julia’s car door for her and said, “To be
continued.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be continued. But I need you to tell me we’re on the
same page here.”</p>

<p>“That I don’t believe him?”</p>

<p>“That whatever you believe, you’re going to help me make clear
that we are disappointed, and that he has to apologize.”</p>

<p>Jacob hated this. He hated Julia for forcing him to betray Sam,
and he hated himself for not standing up to her. If there had been any hatred
left, it would have been for Sam.</p>

<p>“OK,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, getting into the car. “To be continued
tonight.”</p>

<p>“OK,” he said, shutting the door. “And take as long as you want
today.”</p>

<p>“What if as long as I want doesn’t fit in a day?”</p>

<p>“And I have that HBO meeting.”</p>

<p>“What meeting?”</p>

<p>“But not until seven. I mentioned it. You probably would’ve come
back by then, anyway.”</p>

<p>“We’ll never know.”</p>

<p>“It’s annoying that it’s on a weekend, but it’ll only be an hour
or two.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine.”</p>

<p>He gave her arm a squeeze and said, “Take what’s left.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The day.”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>The drive home was silent, save for NPR, whose omnipresence took
on the character of silence. Jacob glanced at Sam in the rearview mirror.</p>

<p>“I went and done ate a can of your tuna fish, Ms. Daisy.”</p>

<p>“Are you having a stroke or something?”</p>

<p>“Movie reference. And might’ve been salmon.”</p>

<p>He knew he shouldn’t let Sam use his iPad in the backseat, but
the poor kid had been through enough that morning. A little self-soothing
seemed fair. And it deferred the conversation that he didn’t feel like having
right then, or ever.</p>

<p>Jacob had planned on preparing an elaborate brunch, but when the
call from Rabbi Singer came at nine fifteen, he asked his parents, Irv and
Deborah, to come over early to watch Max and Benjy. Now there would be no
ricotta-stuffed brioche french toast. There would be no lentil salad, no shaved
brussels sprout salad. There would be calories.</p>

<p>“Two pieces of rye with creamy peanut butter, cut diagonally,”
Jacob said, handing a plate to Benjy.</p>

<p>Max intercepted the food: “That’s actually mine.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Jacob said, handing a bowl to Benjy, “because you have
Honey Nut Cheerios with a splash of rice milk.”</p>

<p>Max examined Benjy’s bowl: “Those are plain Cheerios with honey
on them.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So why did you lie to him?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Max.”</p>

<p>“And I said toasted, not immolated.”</p>

<p>“Imlated?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“Destroyed by fire,” Deborah said.</p>

<p>“What’s with Camus?” Irv asked.</p>

<p>“Leave him alone,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Hey, Maxy,” Irv said, pulling his grandson into him, “someone
once told me about the most incredible zoo…”</p>

<p>“Where’s Sam?” Deborah asked.</p>

<p>“Lying is bad,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>Max let out a laugh.</p>

<p>“Good one,” Irv said. “Right?”</p>

<p>“He got into a little trouble at Hebrew school this morning and
is doing time up in his room.” And to Benjy: “I didn’t lie.”</p>

<p>Max peered into Benjy’s bowl and told him, “You realize that’s
not even honey. It’s agave.”</p>

<p>“I want Mom.”</p>

<p>“We’re giving her a day off.”</p>

<p>“A day off from us?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“No, no. She never needs time off from you guys.”</p>

<p>“Time off from you?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“One of my friends, Joey, has two dads. But babies come out of
vagina holes. Why?”</p>

<p>“Why what?”</p>

<p>“Why did you lie to me?”</p>

<p>“No one lied to anyone.”</p>

<p>“I want a frozen burrito.”</p>

<p>“The freezer’s broken,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“For breakfast?” Deborah asked.</p>

<p>“Brunch,” Max corrected.</p>

<p>“Sí se puede,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“I could run out and get you one,” Deborah offered.</p>

<p>“Frozen.”</p>

<p>Over the previous months, Benjy’s eating habits had veered
toward what might be called unrealized foods: frozen vegetables (as in, still
frozen when eaten), uncooked oatmeal, unboiled ramen noodles, dough, raw
quinoa, dry macaroni with unreconstituted cheese powder sprinkled on top.
Beyond adjusting shopping lists, Jacob and Julia never talked about it; it felt
too psychological to touch.</p>

<p>“So what did Sammy do?” Irv asked, his mouth full of gluten.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later.”</p>

<p>“Frozen burrito, please.”</p>

<p>“There might not be a later.”</p>

<p>“Apparently, he wrote some bad words on a piece of paper in
class.”</p>

<p>“Apparently?”</p>

<p>“He says he didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, did he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Julia thinks so.”</p>

<p>“Whatever the reality, and whatever each of you believes, you
guys have to approach it together,” Deborah said.</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“And remind me what a bad word is?” Irv said.</p>

<p>“You can imagine.”</p>

<p>“In fact I can’t. I can imagine bad contexts—”</p>

<p>“The words and the context of Hebrew school definitely didn’t jibe.”</p>

<p>“Which words?”</p>

<p>“Does it really matter?”</p>

<p>“Of course it really matters.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Deborah said.</p>

<p>“Let’s just say the n-word was featured.”</p>

<p>“I want a frozen— What’s the n-word?”</p>

<p>“Happy now?” Jacob asked his father.</p>

<p>“He used it actively or passively?” Irv asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later,” Max said to his little brother.</p>

<p>“There’s no passive use of that word,” Jacob said to Irv. “And
no, you won’t,” he said to Max.</p>

<p>“There might not be a later,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“Did I really raise a son who refers to a word as that word?”</p>

<p>“No,” Jacob said, “you didn’t raise a son.”</p>

<p>Benjy went to his grandma, who never said no: “If you love me
you’ll get me a frozen burrito and tell me what the n-word is.”</p>

<p>“And what was the context?” Irv asked.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Jacob said, “and we’re done talking about
it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing could matter more. Without context, we’d all be
monsters.”</p>

<p>“N-word,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>Jacob put down his fork and knife.</p>

<p>“OK, since you asked, the context is Sam watching you make a
fool of yourself on the news every morning, and watching you being made a fool
of on late shows every night.”</p>

<p>“You let your kids watch too much TV.”</p>

<p>“They watch hardly any.”</p>

<p>“Can we go watch TV?” Max asked.</p>

<p>Jacob ignored him and went back at Irv: “He’s suspended until he
agrees to apologize. No apology, no bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“Apologize to whom?”</p>

<p>“Premium cable?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“Everyone.”</p>

<p>“Why not go all the way and extradite him to Uganda for some
scrotal electrocution?”</p>

<p>Jacob handed a plate to Max and whispered something in his ear.
Max nodded and left the table.</p>

<p>“He did something wrong,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Exercising his freedom of speech?”</p>

<p>“Freedom of hate speech.”</p>

<p>“Have you even banged a teacher’s desk yet?”</p>

<p>“No, no. Absolutely not. We had a talk with the rabbi, and now
we’re fully in salvage-the-bar-mitzvah mode.”</p>

<p>“You had a talk? You think talk got us out of Egypt or Entebbe?
Uh-uh. Plagues and Uzis. Talk gets you a good place in line for a shower that
isn’t a shower.”</p>

<p>“Jesus, Dad. Always?”</p>

<p>“Of course always. ‘Always’ so ‘never again.’”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say you leave this one to me?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re doing such a great job?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s Sam’s father,” Deborah said. “And you’re not.”</p>

<p>“Because it’s one thing to pick up your dog’s shits,” Jacob
said, “and it’s another to pick up your dad’s.”</p>

<p>“Shits,” Benjy echoed.</p>

<p>“Mom, could you go read to Benjy upstairs?”</p>

<p>“I want to be with the adults,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“I’m the only adult here,” Deborah said.</p>

<p>“Before I blow my top,” Irv said, “I want to be sure I’m
understanding. You’re suggesting that there’s a line to be drawn from my
misread blog to Sam’s First Amendment problem?”</p>

<p>“No one misread your blog.”</p>

<p>“Radically misconstrued.”</p>

<p>“You wrote that Arabs hate their children.”</p>

<p>“Incorrect. I wrote that Arab hatred for Jews has transcended
their love for their own children.”</p>

<p>“And that they are animals.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I wrote that, too. They’re animals. Humans are animals.
This is definitional stuff.”</p>

<p>“Jews are animals?”</p>

<p>“It’s not that simple, no.”</p>

<p>“What’s the n-word?” Benjy whispered to Deborah.</p>

<p>“Noodle,” she whispered back.</p>

<p>“No it’s not.” She lifted Benjy in her arms and carried him out
of the room. “The n-word is no,” he said, “isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No it’s not.”</p>

<p>“One Dr. Phil is already one too many,” Irv said. “What Sammy
needs is a fixer. This is a bone-dry freedom of speech issue, and as you do or
should know, I am not only on the national board of the ACLU, its members tell
my story every Passover. If you were me—”</p>

<p>“I’d kill myself to spare my family.”</p>

<p>“—you’d chum the Adas Israel waters for an insanely smart,
autistically monomaniacal lawyer who has sacrificed worldly rewards for the
pleasure of defending civil liberties. Look, I appreciate the pleasure of
bitching about injustice as much as anyone, but you’re capable, Jacob, and he’s
your son. No one would condemn you for not helping yourself, but no one would
forgive you for not helping your son.”</p>

<p>“You’re romanticizing racism, misogyny, and homophobia.”</p>

<p>“Have you even read Caro’s—”</p>

<p>“I saw the movie.”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to get my grandson out of a bind. That’s so wrong?”</p>

<p>“If he shouldn’t get out of it.”</p>

<p>Benjy trotted back into the room: “Is it married?”</p>

<p>“Is what married?”</p>

<p>“The n-word.”</p>

<p>“That begins with an m.”</p>

<p>Benjy turned and trotted back out.</p>

<p>“What your mother said before, about you and Julia needing to
approach this together? That was wrong. You need to defend Sam. Let everyone
else worry about what actually happened.”</p>

<p>“I believe him.”</p>

<p>And then, as if noticing her absence for the first time: “Where
is Julia, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Taking the day off.”</p>

<p>“Off from what?”</p>

<p>“Off.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Anne Sullivan, but in fact I heard you. Off from
what?”</p>

<p>“From on. Can you just let it be?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Irv said, nodding. “That’s an option. But let me speak
some words of wisdom that not even Mother Mary knows.”</p>

<p>“Can’t wait.”</p>

<p>“Nothing goes away. Not on its own. You deal with it, or it
deals with you.”</p>

<p>“This too shall—?”</p>

<p>“Solomon wasn’t perfect. In all of human history, nothing has
ever gone away on its own.”</p>

<p>“Farts do,” Jacob said, as if to honor Sam’s absence.</p>

<p>“Your house stinks, Jacob. You just can’t smell it, because it’s
yours.”</p>

<p>Jacob could have pointed out that there was Argus shit somewhere
within a three-room radius. He’d known it as soon as he opened the front door.</p>

<p>Benjy came back into the room. “I remembered my question,” he
said, despite having given no indication of trying to remember anything.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“The sound of time. What happened to it?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A HAND THE SIZE OF YOURS, A HOUSE THE SIZE OF THIS ONE</h2>

<p>Julia liked the eye being led where the body can’t go. She liked
irregular brickwork, when one can’t tell if the craftsmanship is careless or
masterly. She liked the feeling of enclosure, with the suggestion of
expansiveness. She liked it when the view wasn’t centered in the window, but
also liked remembering that views are, by nature’s nature, centered. She liked
doorknobs that one wants to keep holding. She liked steps up, and steps down.
She liked shadows laid upon other shadows. She liked breakfast banquettes. She
liked light woods (beech, maple), and didn’t like “masculine” woods (walnut,
mahogany), and didn’t care for steel, and hated stainless steel (until it was
thoroughly scratched), and imitations of natural materials were intolerable,
unless their fakeness was declared, was the point, in which case they could be
quite beautiful. She liked textures that the fingers and feet know, even if the
eye doesn’t. She liked fireplaces centered in kitchens centered on the main
living floor. She liked more bookshelves than are necessary. She liked
skylights over showers, but nowhere else. She liked intentional imperfections,
but she couldn’t bear nonchalance, but she also liked to remember that there
could be no such thing as an intentional imperfection. People are always
mistaking something that looks good for something that feels good.</p>

<p>you’re begging me to fuck your tight pussy, but you don’t
deserve it yet</p>

<p>She didn’t like uniform textures—they aren’t how things are. She
didn’t like rugs centered in rooms. Good architecture should make one feel as
if one is in a cave with a view of the horizon. She didn’t like double-height
ceilings. She didn’t like too much glass. The function of a window is to bring
in light, not to frame a view. A ceiling should be just out of reach of the
extended fingers of a raised hand of the tallest occupant standing on tiptoes.
She didn’t like carefully placed trinkets—things belong where they don’t. An
eleven-foot ceiling is too high. It makes one feel lost, forsaken. A ten-foot
ceiling is too high. She felt that everything was out of reach. Nine feet is
too high. Something that feels good—safe, comfortable, designed for living—can
always be made to look good. She didn’t like recessed lighting, or lamps
controlled by wall switches—so sconces, chandeliers, and effort. She didn’t
like concealed functions—refrigerators behind panels, toiletries behind
mirrors, TVs that descend into cabinets.</p>

<p>you don’t need it enough yet</p>

<p>i want to see you dripping onto your asshole</p>

<p>Every architect has fantasies of building her own home, and so
does every woman. For as long as she could remember, Julia had felt a secret
thrill whenever she passed a small parking lot or an undeveloped slice of land:
potential. For what? To build something beautiful? Intelligent? New? Or simply
for a home that might feel like home? Her joys were shared, not fully hers, but
her thrills were private.</p>

<p>She had never wanted to become an architect, but she always
wanted to make a home for herself. She disposed of the dolls to free the boxes
they came in. She spent a summer furnishing the space under her bed. Her
clothes covered every surface in her room, because closets shouldn’t be wasted
with utility. It wasn’t until she started designing homes for herself—all on
paper, each a source of pride and shame—that she came to understand what was
meant by “herself.”</p>

<p>“This is so great,” Jacob said while being led through a floor
plan. Julia never shared her personal work with him unless he explicitly asked.
It wasn’t a secret, but the experience of sharing always seemed to leave her
feeling humiliated. He was never enthusiastic enough, or not in the right ways.
And when his enthusiasm came, it felt like a gift with too precious a bow. (The
so ruined everything.) He was filing away his enthusiasm for future retrieval
the next time she said he was never enthusiastic about her work. And it
humiliated her, also, to need his enthusiasm, even to want it.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with such wanting and needing? Nothing. And the
yawning distance from where you are to what you’d always imagined does not have
to suggest failure. Disappointment need not be disappointing. The wanting, the
needing, the distance, the disappointment: growing, knowing, committing, aging
beside another. Alone, one can live perfectly. But not a life.</p>

<p>“It’s great,” he said, so close his nose almost touched the
two-dimensional rendering of her fantasy. “Amazing, actually. How do you think
of these things?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I do think of them.”</p>

<p>“This is what, an interior garden?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, the stairs will rise around a light shaft.”</p>

<p>“Sam would say, ‘Shaft…’”</p>

<p>“And you would laugh, and I would ignore it.”</p>

<p>“Or we’d both ignore it. Anyway, this is really, really nice.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Jacob touched his finger to the floor plan, moved it through a
series of rooms, always through the doors. “I know I’m no good at reading these
things, but where would the kids sleep?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Unless I’m misunderstanding something here, which is probably
the case, there’s only one bedroom.”</p>

<p>Julia tilted her head, squinted.</p>

<p>Jacob said, “You know the one about the couple who get divorced
after eighty years of marriage?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Everyone asks, ‘Why now? Why not decades ago, when there was
still life to live? Or why not just see it through to the end?’ And they
respond, ‘We were waiting for the grandchildren to die.’”</p>

<p>Julia liked calculators that printed—the Jews of the office
store, having stubbornly out-survived so many more-promising business
machines—and while the kids assembled school supplies, she would tap out feet
of numbers. Once, she calculated the minutes until Benjy went to college. She
left it there, as evidence.</p>

<p>Her homes were just stupid little exercises, a hobby. She and
Jacob would never have the money, nor the time and energy, and she’d done
enough residential architecture to know that the desire to wring out a few more
drips of happiness almost always destroyed the happiness you were so lucky to
have, and so foolish never to acknowledge. It happens every time: a
forty-thousand-dollar kitchen remodel becomes a seventy-five-thousand-dollar
kitchen remodel (because everyone comes to believe that small differences make big
differences), becomes a new exit to the garden (to bring more light into the
enhanced kitchen), becomes a new bathroom (if you’re already sealing off the
floor for work…), becomes stupidly rewiring the house to be smart (so you can
control the music in the kitchen with your phone), becomes passive-aggression
over whether the new bookshelves should be on legs (to reveal the inlaid floor
borders), becomes aggressive-aggression whose origin can no longer be
remembered. One can build a perfect home, but not live in it.</p>

<p>do you like my tongue pushing its way between your tight lips?</p>

<p>show me</p>

<p>cum on my mouth</p>

<p>There was a night, early in their marriage, at a Pennsylvania
inn. She and Jacob shared a joint—the first time either had smoked since
college—and lay in bed naked, and promised to share everything, everything
without exception, regardless of the shame or discomfort or potential for hurt.
It felt like the most ambitious promise two people could make to each other.
Basic truth telling felt like a revelation.</p>

<p>“No exceptions,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Even one would undermine everything.”</p>

<p>“Bed-wetting. That kind of thing.”</p>

<p>Julia took Jacob’s hand and said, “Do you know how much I’d love
you for sharing something like that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t happen to bed-wet, by the way. I’m just establishing
boundaries.”</p>

<p>“No boundaries. That’s the point.”</p>

<p>“Past sexual encounters?” Jacob asked, because he knew it was
the address of his greatest vulnerability, and so the place such sharing would
have to go. Always, even after he’d lost the desire to touch or be touched by
her, he abhorred the thought of her touching or being touched by another man.
People she’d been with, pleasure she’d given and received, things she’d moaned.
He was not an insecure person in other contexts, but his brain was compelled, with
the magnetism of someone unable to escape the perpetual reliving of a trauma,
to imagine her being sexually intimate with others. What did she say to them
that she also said to him? Why would such repetitions feel like the ultimate
betrayal?</p>

<p>“Of course they would be painful,” she said. “But the point
isn’t that I want to know everything about you. It’s that I don’t want anything
about you withheld.”</p>

<p>“So I won’t.”</p>

<p>“And I won’t.”</p>

<p>They passed the joint back and forth a few times, feeling so
brave, so still-young.</p>

<p>“What are you withholding right now?” she asked, almost giddily.</p>

<p>“Right now, nothing.”</p>

<p>“But you have withheld?”</p>

<p>“Therefore I am.”</p>

<p>She laughed. She loved his quickness, the oddly comforting
warmth of his mind’s connections.</p>

<p>“What’s the last thing you withheld from me?”</p>

<p>He thought about it. Being stoned made it harder to think, but
easier to share thoughts.</p>

<p>“OK,” he said. “It’s a little one.”</p>

<p>“I want all of them.”</p>

<p>“OK. We were in the apartment the other day. It was Wednesday,
maybe? And I made breakfast for you. Remember? The goat cheese frittata.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” she said, resting her hand on his thigh, “that was
nice.”</p>

<p>“I let you sleep in, and I secretly made breakfast.”</p>

<p>She exhaled a column of smoke that held its form for longer than
seemed possible, and said, “I could eat a lot of that right now.”</p>

<p>“I made it because I wanted to take care of you.”</p>

<p>“I felt that,” she said, moving her hand up his thigh, making
him hard.</p>

<p>“And I made it look really nice on the plate. That little salad
beside it.”</p>

<p>“Like a restaurant,” she said, taking his cock in her hand.</p>

<p>“And after your first bite—”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“There’s a reason people withhold.”</p>

<p>“We’re not people.”</p>

<p>“OK. Well, after your first bite, instead of thanking me, or
saying it was delicious, you asked me if I’d salted it.”</p>

<p>“So?” she asked, moving her fist up and down.</p>

<p>“So that felt like shit.”</p>

<p>“That I asked if it was salted?”</p>

<p>“Maybe not felt like shit. It annoyed me. Or disappointed me.
Whatever I felt, I didn’t share it.”</p>

<p>“But I was just asking a matter-of-fact question.”</p>

<p>“That feels good.”</p>

<p>“Good, love.”</p>

<p>“But can you see how, in the context of the effort I was making
for you, asking if it was salted conveyed criticism rather than gratefulness?”</p>

<p>“It feels like an effort to cook breakfast for me?”</p>

<p>“It was a special breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Does this feel good?”</p>

<p>“It feels amazing.”</p>

<p>“So in the future, if I think a food needs more salt, I should
keep that to myself?”</p>

<p>“Or it sounds like I should keep my hurt to myself.”</p>

<p>“Your disappointment.”</p>

<p>“I could already come.”</p>

<p>“So come.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to come yet.”</p>

<p>She slowed down, slowed to a grip.</p>

<p>“What are you withholding right now?” he asked. “And don’t say
that you’re slightly hurt, annoyed, and disappointed by my hurt, annoyance, and
disappointment, because you’re not withholding that.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“I’m not withholding anything,” she said.</p>

<p>“Dig.”</p>

<p>She shook her head and laughed.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“In the car, you were singing ‘All Apologies’ and you kept
singing, ‘I can see from shame.’”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“So that’s not what it is.”</p>

<p>“Of course that’s what it is.”</p>

<p>“Aqua seafoam shame.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Yup.”</p>

<p>“Aqua. Seafoam. Shame?”</p>

<p>“My hand upon the Jewish Bible.”</p>

<p>“You’re telling me that my perfectly sensical phrase—sensical on
its own, and in its context—is actually just a subconscious expression of my
repressed whatever, and that Kurt Cobain intentionally strung together the
words aqua seafoam shame?”</p>

<p>“That is what I’m telling you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I cannot believe that. But at the same time, I’m
extremely embarrassed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be.”</p>

<p>“That usually works when someone’s embarrassed.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“That shouldn’t count,” he said. “Hobbyist withholding. Give me
something good.”</p>

<p>“Good?”</p>

<p>“Something really difficult.”</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>“What?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Sure sounds like something.”</p>

<p>“OK,” she said. “I’m withholding something. Something really
difficult.”</p>

<p>“Excellent.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think I’m evolved enough to share.”</p>

<p>“So went the dinosaurs.”</p>

<p>She pressed a pillow over her face and scissored her legs.</p>

<p>“It’s just me,” he said.</p>

<p>“OK,” with a sigh. “OK. Well. Lying here, stoned, our bodies
naked, I just had a desire.”</p>

<p>He instinctively reached his hand between her legs, and found
that she was already wet.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said.</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“I bet you can.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“Close your eyes,” he said. “It will make it easier.”</p>

<p>She closed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Nope,” she said. “Not easier. Maybe if you close yours?”</p>

<p>He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m having this desire. I don’t know where it comes from. I
don’t know why I’m having it.”</p>

<p>“But you’re having it.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Tell me.”</p>

<p>“I’m having this desire.” She laughed again, and nuzzled her
face into his armpit. “I want to spread my legs, and I want you to move your
head down and look at me until I come.”</p>

<p>“Only look?”</p>

<p>“No fingers. No tongue. I want your eyes to make me come.”</p>

<p>“Open your eyes.”</p>

<p>“And you open yours.”</p>

<p>He didn’t say a word or make a sound. With enough but not too
much force, he rolled her onto her stomach. He intuited that what she wanted
involved her inability to see him looking at her, for that final safety to be
given over. She moaned, letting him know he was right. He moved his body down
her body. He parted her legs, then spread them farther. He tucked his face
close enough to smell her.</p>

<p>“You’re looking at me?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Do you like what you see?”</p>

<p>“I want what I see.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t touch it.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>“But you can jerk yourself off while you look at me.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“You want to fuck what you’re looking at.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You want to feel how wet I am.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t.”</p>

<p>“But I can see.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t see how tight I get when I’m about to come.”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what I look like and I’ll come.”</p>

<p>They came together, without touching, and it could have ended
there. She could have rolled onto her side, put her head on his chest. They
could have fallen asleep. But something happened: she looked at him, held his
gaze, and once again closed her eyes. Jacob closed his eyes. And it could have
ended there. They could have explored each other in the bed, but Julia rose and
explored the room. Jacob didn’t see her—he knew not to open his eyes—but he
heard her. Without saying anything, he also got up. They each touched the bench
at the foot of the bed, the desk and the cup with its pens, the tassels on the
curtain tiebacks. He touched the peephole, she touched the dial that controlled
the ceiling fan, he pressed his palm against the mini-fridge’s warm top.</p>

<p>She said, “You make sense to me.”</p>

<p>He said, “You, too.”</p>

<p>She said, “I really love you, Jacob. But please just say ‘I
know.’”</p>

<p>He said, “I know,” and felt along the walls, along the mounted
quilts, until he came to the light switch. “I think I just made it dark.”</p>

<p>Julia became pregnant with Sam a year later. Then Max. Then
Benjy. Her body changed, but Jacob’s desire didn’t. It was their volume of
withholding that changed. They continued to have sex, although what had always
arisen spontaneously came to require either an impetus (drunkenness, watching
Blue Is the Warmest Color on Jacob’s laptop in bed, Valentine’s Day) or
muscling through the self-consciousness and fear of embarrassment, which usually
led to big orgasms and no kissing. They still occasionally said things that,
the moment after coming, felt humiliating to the point of needing to physically
remove oneself to get an unwanted glass of water. Each still masturbated to
thoughts of the other, even if those fantasies bore no blood relationship to
lived life and often included another other. But even the memory of that night
in Pennsylvania had to be withheld, because it was a horizontal line on a
doorframe: Look at how much we’ve changed.</p>

<p>There were things Jacob wanted, and he wanted them from Julia.
But the possibility of sharing desires diminished as her need to hear them
increased. It was the same for her. They loved each other’s company, and would
always choose it over either aloneness or the company of anyone else, but the
more comfort they found together, the more life they shared, the more estranged
they became from their inner lives.</p>

<p>In the beginning, they were always either consuming each other
or consuming the world together. Every child wants to see the marks ascend the
doorframe, but how many couples are able to see progress in simply staying the
same? How many can make more money and not contemplate what could be bought
with it? How many, approaching the end of child-bearing years, can know that
they already have the right number of children?</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia were never ones to resist convention on
principle, but neither could they have imagined becoming quite so conventional:
they got a second car (and second-car insurance); joined a gym with a
twenty-page course offering; stopped doing their taxes themselves; occasionally
sent back a bottle of wine; bought a house with side-by-side sinks (and house
insurance); doubled their toiletries; had a teak enclosure built for their
garbage bins; replaced a stove with one that looked better; had a child (and
bought life insurance); ordered vitamins from California and mattresses from
Sweden; bought organic clothing whose price, amortized over the number of times
it was worn, all but required them to have another child. They had another
child. They considered whether a rug would hold its value, knew which of
everything was best (Miele vacuum, Vitamix blender, Misono knives, Farrow and
Ball paint), consumed Freudian amounts of sushi, and worked harder so they
could pay the very best people to care for their children while they worked.
They had another child.</p>

<p>Their inner lives were overwhelmed by all the living—not only in
terms of the time and energy required by a family of five, but of which muscles
were forced to strengthen and which withered. Julia’s unwavering composure with
the children had grown to resemble omnipatience, while her capacity to express
urgency to her husband had shrunk to texted Poems of the Day. Jacob’s magic
trick of removing Julia’s bra without his hands was replaced by the
depressingly impressive ability to assemble a Pack ’n Play as he carried it up
the stairs. Julia could clip newborn fingernails with her teeth, and
breast-feed while making a lasagna, and remove splinters without tweezers or
pain, and have the kids begging for the lice comb, and compel sleep with a
third-eye massage—but she had forgotten how to touch her husband. Jacob taught
the kids the difference between farther and further, but no longer knew how to
talk to his wife.</p>

<p>Their inner lives were nurtured in private—Julia designed houses
for herself; Jacob worked on his bible, and bought a second phone—and a
destructive cycle developed between them: with Julia’s inability to express
urgency, Jacob became even less sure that he was wanted, and more afraid of
risking foolishness, which furthered the distance between Julia’s hand and
Jacob’s body, which Jacob had no language to address. Desire became a threat—an
enemy—to their domesticity.</p>

<p>When Max was in kindergarten, he used to give everything away.
Any friend who would come over for a playdate would inevitably leave with a
plastic car or stuffed animal. Any money that he somehow acquired—change found
on the sidewalk, a five-dollar bill from his grandfather for having made a
persuasive argument—would be offered to Julia in a checkout line, or to Jacob
at a parking meter. He invited Sam to take as much of his dessert as he liked.
“Go on,” he would say when Sam demurred. “Take, take.”</p>

<p>Max wasn’t responding to the needs of others, which he seemed as
capable of ignoring as any child. And he wasn’t being generous—that would
require the knowledge of giving, which was precisely what he lacked. Everyone
has a pipeline through which he pushes what he is willing and able to share of
himself out into the world, and through which he takes in all of the world that
he is willing and able to bear. Max’s conduit wasn’t bigger than anyone else’s,
it was simply unclogged.</p>

<p>What had been a source of pride for Jacob and Julia became a
source of concern: Max will be left with nothing. Careful not to suggest that
there was anything wrong with the way he lived, they gently introduced notions
of worth, and the finitude of resources. At first he resisted—“There’s always
more”—but as children do, he came to understand that there was something wrong
with the way he lived.</p>

<p>He became obsessed with comparative value. “Could you get one
house for forty cars?” (“It depends on the house and the cars.”) Or, “Would you
rather have a handful of diamonds or a houseful of silver? A hand the size of
yours, a house the size of this one.” He started trading compulsively: toys
with friends, belongings with Sam, deeds with his parents. (“If I eat half of
this kale, will you let me go to bed twenty minutes later?”) He wanted to know
if it was better to be a FedEx driver or a music teacher, and became frustrated
when his parents challenged his use of better. He wanted to know if it was OK
that his dad had to pay for an extra ticket when they took his friend Clive to
the zoo. “I’m wasting my life!” he would often exclaim when not engaged in an
activity. He crawled into bed with them, too early one morning, wanting to know
if that’s what being dead is.</p>

<p>“What’s that, baby?”</p>

<p>“Having nothing.”</p>

<p>The withholding of sexual needs between Jacob and Julia was the
most primitive and frustrating kind of withdrawal, but hardly the most
damaging. The movement toward estrangement—from each other, and from
themselves—took place in far smaller, subtler steps. They were always becoming
closer in the realm of doing—coordinating the ever-expanding routines, talking
and texting more (and more efficiently), cleaning together the mess made by the
children they made—and farther in feeling.</p>

<p>Once, Julia bought some lingerie. She’d placed her palm atop the
soft stack, not because she had any interest, but because, like her mother, she
couldn’t control the impulse to touch merchandise in stores. She took five
hundred dollars out of an ATM so it wouldn’t show up on the credit card bill.
She wanted to share it with Jacob, and tried her best to find or create the
right occasion. One night, after the kids were asleep, she put on the panties.
She wanted to descend the stairs, cap Jacob’s pen, not say a word, but
communicate: Look how I can look. But she couldn’t. Just as she couldn’t bring
herself to put them on before bed, fearing his not noticing. Just as she
couldn’t even lay them on the bed for him to come upon and ask about. Just as
she couldn’t return them.</p>

<p>Once, Jacob wrote a line he thought was the best he’d ever
written. He wanted to share it with Julia—not because he was proud of himself,
but because he wanted to see if it was still possible to reach her as he used
to, to inspire her to say something like “You’re my writer.” He took the pages
into the kitchen, laid them facedown on the counter.</p>

<p>“How’s it going?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It’s going,” he said, in precisely the way he most hated.</p>

<p>“Progress?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just not clear it’s in the right direction.”</p>

<p>“Is there a right direction?”</p>

<p>He wanted to say, “Just say, ‘You’re my writer.’”</p>

<p>But he couldn’t cross the distance that didn’t exist. The
vastness of their shared life made sharing their singularity impossible. They
needed a distance that wasn’t a withdrawal, but a beckoning. And when Jacob
returned to the line the next morning, he was surprised and saddened to see
that it was still great.</p>

<p>Once, Julia was washing her hands at the bathroom sink, after
having cleaned up yet another Argus shit, and as she observed the soap forming
webs between her fingers, the sconce flickered but persisted, and she was
unexpectedly overwhelmed by a kind of sadness that didn’t refer to or mean
anything, but whose weight was punishing. She wanted to bring that sadness to
Jacob—not with the hope of his understanding something that she couldn’t
understand, but with the hope that he might help carry something that she
couldn’t carry. But the distance that didn’t exist was too great. Argus had
shit on his bed, and either didn’t realize it or couldn’t be bothered to move;
it got all over his side and tail. While Julia scrubbed it off with human
shampoo and a damp T-shirt from some forgotten soccer team that once broke
hearts, she told him, “Here we go. It’s OK. Almost finished.”</p>

<p>Once, Jacob considered buying a brooch for Julia. He had wandered
into a store on Connecticut Avenue—the kind of place that sells salad bowls
turned from reclaimed wood, and salad tongs with horn handles. He wasn’t
looking to buy anything, and there was no upcoming occasion for which a gift
would have been appropriate. His lunch date had texted that she was stuck
behind a garbage truck, he hadn’t thought to bring along a book or newspaper,
and every chair in Starbucks was occupied by someone who would finish his
thinning life before finishing his thinly veiled memoir, leaving Jacob no place
to go deep into his very thin phone.</p>

<p>“Is that one nice?” he asked the woman on the other side of the
case. “Dumb question.”</p>

<p>“I love it,” she said.</p>

<p>“Right, of course you do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that,” she said, pointing at a bracelet in the
case.</p>

<p>“It’s a brooch, right?”</p>

<p>“It is. A silver cast of an actual twig. One-of-a-kind.”</p>

<p>“And those are opals?”</p>

<p>“They are.”</p>

<p>He walked to another section, pretended to examine an inlaid
cutting board, then returned to the brooch. “It’s nice, though, right? I can’t
tell if it looks costumey.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she said, taking it from the case and putting it
on a velvet-lined tray.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Jacob said, not picking it up.</p>

<p>Was it nice? It was risky. Did people wear brooches? Was it
cornily figurative? Would it end up in a jewelry box, never to be seen again
until it was bequeathed as an heirloom to one of the boys’ brides so that she
could put it in a jewelry box until it was one day passed down again? Was seven
hundred fifty dollars an appropriate price for such a thing? It wasn’t the
money that concerned him, it was the risk of getting it wrong, the
embarrassment of trying and failing—an extended limb is far easier to break
than a bent one. After lunch, Jacob went back to the store.</p>

<p>“Sorry if I’m being ridiculous,” he said, returning to the woman
who had been helping him, “but would you mind putting it on?”</p>

<p>She took it back out of the case and pinned it to her sweater.</p>

<p>“And it’s not heavy? It doesn’t pull on the fabric?”</p>

<p>“It’s quite light.”</p>

<p>“Is it fancy?”</p>

<p>“You could wear it with a dress, or on a jacket, or sweater.”</p>

<p>“And you would be happy if someone gave it to you?”</p>

<p>Distance begets distance, but if the distance is nothing, what
is its origin? There was no transgression, no cruelty, not even indifference.
The original distance was closeness: the inability to overcome the shame of
subterranean needs that no longer had a home aboveground.</p>

<p>give me your cum</p>

<p>then you can have my cock</p>

<p>Only in the privacy of her own mind could Julia wonder what her
own home would look like. What she would gain, and what she would lose. Could
she live without seeing the kids every morning and evening? And what if she
were to admit that she could? In six and a half million minutes, she would have
to. No one judges a mother for letting her children go to college. Letting go
wasn’t the crime. The crime was choosing to let go.</p>

<p>you don’t deserve to get fucked in the ass</p>

<p>If she built a new life for herself, so would Jacob. He would
remarry. Men do. They get over it, and get on with it. Every time. It was easy
to imagine him marrying the first person he dated. He deserved someone who
didn’t build imaginary homes for one. He didn’t deserve Julia, but he deserved
better than Julia. He deserved someone who stretched upon waking, rather than
recoiled. Someone who didn’t sniff food before eating it. Someone who didn’t
see pets as burdens, who had a pet name for him, and made jokes in front of
friends about how much she liked being fucked by him. Some new, unclogged
pipeline to a new person, and even if it were doomed to ultimately fail, at
least the failure would be preceded by happiness.</p>

<p>now you deserve to get fucked in the ass</p>

<p>She needed a day off. She would have loved the feeling of not
knowing how to fill the time, of wandering without a destination in Rock Creek
Park, of actually savoring a meal of the kind of food that her kids would never
tolerate, and reading something longer and of more substance than a sidebar
about how better to organize emotions or spices. But one of her clients needed
help selecting door hardware. Of course it had to be a Saturday, because when
else could someone who was able to afford bespoke hardware have time to sample
it? And of course no one needs help to look at door hardware, but Mark and
Jennifer were unusually helpless when it came to negotiating their incompatible
lacks of taste, and a doorknob was exactly unimportant and symbolic enough to
require mediation.</p>

<p>Compounding Julia’s irritation was the fact that Mark and
Jennifer were the parents of one of Sam’s friends, and thought of Jacob and
Julia as their friends, and wanted to have a coffee after to “catch up.” Julia
liked them and, insofar as she could muster enthusiasm for extrafamilial
relations, considered them friends. But she couldn’t muster much. At least not
until she could catch up with herself.</p>

<p>Someone needed to invent a way to be close to people without
having to see them, or talk to them on the phone, or write (or read) letters,
or e-mails, or texts. Was it only mothers who understood the preciousness of
time? That there was none of it, ever? And you can’t just have coffee, even and
especially not with people you rarely see, because it takes half an hour to
reach the café (if you’re lucky), and half an hour to return home (if you’re
lucky again), not to mention the twenty-minute tax you pay just to get out the
door, and a quick coffee ends up being forty-five minutes in the Olympic
scenario. And there was the horrible rigmarole at Hebrew school that morning,
and the Israelis were coming in less than two weeks, and the bar mitzvah was
saying its goodbyes in the ICU, and while it’s entirely possible to get help,
help feels bad, help shames. One can order groceries online and have them
delivered, but that feels like a failure, an abdication of motherly
duty—motherly privilege. Driving farther to the store with good produce,
selecting the avocado that will be perfectly ripe at its moment of use, making
sure it doesn’t get crushed in the grocery bag and that the grocery bag doesn’t
get crushed in the cart … it’s a mother’s job. Not job, but joy. What if she
could accomplish the job but not the joy?</p>

<p>She never knew what to do with the feeling of wanting more for
herself: time, space, quiet. Maybe girls would have been different, but she had
boys. For a year she held them against her, but after that sleepless holiday
she was at the mercy of their physicality: their screaming, wrestling, table
drumming, competitive farting, and endless explorations of their scrotums. She
loved it, all of it, but needed time, space, and quiet. Maybe if she’d had
girls, maybe they’d have been more contemplative, less brutish, more
constructive, less animalistic. Even approaching such thoughts made her feel
unmotherly, although she always knew she was a good mother. So why was it so
complicated? There were women who would spend their last pennies to do the
things she resented. Every blessing that was promised the barren heroines of
the Bible had fallen into her open hands like rain. And through them.</p>

<p>i want to lick the cum out of your asshole</p>

<p>She met Mark at the hardware gallery. It was elegant, and it was
obnoxious, and in a world where the bodies of Syrian children washed up on
beaches, it was unethical, or at least vulgar. But her commissions added up.</p>

<p>Mark was already handling samples when she arrived. He looked
good: a tightly cropped, gray-dusted beard; clothes that were intentionally
snug and not bought in sets of three. He had the physical confidence of someone
who doesn’t know within one hundred thousand dollars the contents of his bank
account at any given moment. It wasn’t attractive, but it wasn’t ignorable.</p>

<p>“Julia.”</p>

<p>“Mark.”</p>

<p>“We seem not to have Alzheimer’s.”</p>

<p>“What’s Alzheimer’s?”</p>

<p>Innocent flirtation was so revitalizing—the gentle tickling of
language that gently tickled one’s ego. She was good at it, and loved it,
always had, but grew to feel guilty about it in the course of her marriage. She
knew there was nothing wrong with such playfulness; she wanted Jacob to have it
in his life. But she also knew of his irrational, uncontainable jealousy. And
frustrating as it could be—she never dared to mention a romantic or sexual
experience from her past, and needed to overclarify any remotely
misinterpretable experience in the present—it was part of him, and so something
she wanted to care for.</p>

<p>And it was a part of him that drew her in. His sexual insecurity
was so profound, it could only have sprung from a profound source. And even
when she felt that she knew everything about him, she never knew what created
his insatiable need for reassurance. Sometimes, after deliberately omitting
something innocent that she knew would upset his brittle peace, she would look
at her husband with love and think, What happened to you?</p>

<p>“Sorry I’m late,” she said, adjusting her collar. “Sam got in
some trouble at Hebrew school.”</p>

<p>“Oy vey.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. Anyway, I’m here. Physically and mentally.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we should go get that coffee first?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to quit.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Too dependent on it.”</p>

<p>“That’s only a problem if there isn’t coffee around.”</p>

<p>“And Jacob says—”</p>

<p>“That’s only a problem if Jacob’s around.”</p>

<p>Julia giggled at that, unsure if she was giggling at his joke or
her girlish inability to resist his boyish charm.</p>

<p>“Let’s earn the caffeine,” she said, taking a too-distressed
bronze knob from his hand.</p>

<p>“So I have some news,” Mark said.</p>

<p>“Me, too. Should we wait for Jennifer?”</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t. And that’s my news.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Jennifer and I are getting divorced.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been separated since May.”</p>

<p>“You said divorced.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been separated. We’re getting divorced.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, squeezing the knob, further distressing it, “you
haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t what?”</p>

<p>“Been separated.”</p>

<p>“I would know.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve been together. We went to the Kennedy Center.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were at a play.”</p>

<p>“You laughed, and touched. I saw.”</p>

<p>“We’re friends. Friends laugh.”</p>

<p>“They don’t touch.”</p>

<p>Mark extended his hand and touched Julia’s shoulder. She
reflexively recoiled, eliciting a laugh from each of them.</p>

<p>“We’re friends who were married,” he said.</p>

<p>Julia organized her hair behind her ear and said, “Who still are
married.”</p>

<p>“Who are about not to be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think this is right.”</p>

<p>“Right?”</p>

<p>“Happening.”</p>

<p>He held up his ringless hand: “It’s been happening for at least
long enough to erase a tan line.”</p>

<p>A skinny woman approached.</p>

<p>“Anything I can help with today?”</p>

<p>“Maybe tomorrow,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“I think we’re OK for now,” Mark said, with a smile that
appeared, to Julia, as flirtatious as the one he’d given her.</p>

<p>“I’ll just be over there,” the woman said.</p>

<p>Julia put down the knob with a bit too much force and picked up another,
a stainless octagon—ridiculously effortful, repulsively masculine.</p>

<p>“Well, Mark … I don’t know what to say.”</p>

<p>“Congratulations?”</p>

<p>“Congratulations?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t feel right at all.”</p>

<p>“But it’s my feelings we’re talking about here.”</p>

<p>“Congratulations? Really?”</p>

<p>“I’m young. Just barely, but still.”</p>

<p>“Not just barely.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. We’re resolutely young. If we were seventy it
would be different. Maybe even if we were sixty or fifty. Maybe then I’d say,
This is who I am. This is my lot. But I’m forty-four. A huge portion of my life
hasn’t happened. And the same is true for Jennifer. We realized we would be
happier living other lives. That’s a good thing. Certainly better than
pretending, or repressing, or just being so consumed with the responsibility of
playing a part that you never question if it’s the part you would choose. I’m
still young, Julia, and I want to choose happiness.”</p>

<p>“Happiness?”</p>

<p>“Happiness.”</p>

<p>“Whose happiness?”</p>

<p>“My happiness. Jennifer’s, too. Our happiness, but separately.”</p>

<p>“While we pursue happiness, we flee from contentment.”</p>

<p>“Well, neither my happiness nor contentment is with her. And her
happiness definitely isn’t with me.”</p>

<p>“Where is it? Under a sofa cushion?”</p>

<p>“In fact, under her French tutor.”</p>

<p>“Holy shit,” Julia said, bringing the knob to her forehead
harder than she’d intended.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you’re having this reaction to good news.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t even speak French.”</p>

<p>“And now we know why.”</p>

<p>Julia looked for the anorexic clerk. Anything to look away from
Mark.</p>

<p>“And your happiness?” she asked. “What language are you not
learning?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “For now, I’m happy to be alone. I’ve spent my whole
life with others—my parents, girlfriends, Jennifer. Maybe I want something
different.”</p>

<p>“Loneliness?”</p>

<p>“Aloneness isn’t loneliness.”</p>

<p>“This doorknob is very ugly.”</p>

<p>“Are you upset?”</p>

<p>“Too little distress, too much distress, it isn’t rocket
science.”</p>

<p>“That’s why they save rocket scientists for rocket science.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you haven’t even mentioned the kids.”</p>

<p>“It’s painful.”</p>

<p>“What this is going to do to them. What seeing them half the
time is going to do to you.”</p>

<p>She pressed into the display case, angled herself a few degrees.
No amount of adjusting could make this conversation comfortable, but it would
at least deflect the blow. She put down the knob and picked up one whose only
honest comparison would be the dildo she was given at her bachelorette party,
sixteen years before. It had resembled a penis as little as this knob resembled
a knob. Her girlfriends laughed, and she laughed, and four months later she
came upon it while searching her closet with the hopes of regifting an unopened
matcha whisk, and she found herself bored or hormonal enough to give it a shot.
It accomplished nothing. Too dry. Too unwillful. But holding the ridiculous doorknob,
then, she could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>“I lost my interior monologue,” Mark said.</p>

<p>“Your interior monologue?” Julia asked with a dismissive grin.</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>She handed him the knob: “Mark, it’s your interior monologue
calling. He was mugged by your id in Nigeria and needs you to wire it two
hundred fifty thousand dollars by the end of the day.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it sounds silly. Maybe I sound selfish—”</p>

<p>“Yes and yes.”</p>

<p>“—but I lost what made me me.”</p>

<p>“You’re an adult, Mark, not a Shel Silverstein character contemplating
emotional boo-boos on the stump of a tree whose trunk he used for a dacha, or
whatever.”</p>

<p>“The harder you push back,” he said, “the more sure I am that
you agree.”</p>

<p>“Agree? Agree with what? We’re talking about your life.”</p>

<p>“We’re talking about the endless clenched-jaw worrying about the
kids all day, and the endless replaying of unhad fights with your spouse all
night. You wouldn’t be a happier, more ambitious and productive architect if
you were alone? You wouldn’t be less weary?”</p>

<p>“What, me weary?”</p>

<p>“The more you joke, the more sure—”</p>

<p>“Of course I would.”</p>

<p>“And vacations? You wouldn’t enjoy them more alone?”</p>

<p>“Not so loud.”</p>

<p>“Or someone would hear that you’re human?”</p>

<p>She ran her thumb over the head of the knob.</p>

<p>“Of course I’d miss my kids,” she said. “You wouldn’t?”</p>

<p>“That’s not what I asked.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d prefer to have them with me and them on vacation.”</p>

<p>“Tough sentence to assemble?”</p>

<p>“I would choose their presence. If it were a choice.”</p>

<p>“Is it the never sleeping in, the never enjoying a meal, or the
hypervigilance at the edge of a beach chair that your back will never touch?”</p>

<p>“It’s the fulfillment that has no other source. The first
thought I have every morning, and the last thought every night, is about my
kids.”</p>

<p>“That’s my point.”</p>

<p>“It’s my point.”</p>

<p>“When do you think about yourself?”</p>

<p>“When I think that one day, a few decades from now, which will
feel like a few hours from now, I’ll be facing death all alone, except that I
won’t be all alone, because I’ll be surrounded by my family.”</p>

<p>“Living the wrong life is far worse than dying the wrong death.”</p>

<p>“No shit! I got the same fortune cookie last night!”</p>

<p>Mark leaned closer to Julia.</p>

<p>“Just tell me,” he said, “you wouldn’t like to have your time
and mind back? I’m not asking you to speak badly of your husband or kids. Let’s
take it for granted that you’ve never cared about anything half as much, and
couldn’t care about anything more. I’m not asking for the answer you want to
give, or feel you have to. I know this is hard to think about, much less talk
about. But honestly: you wouldn’t be happier alone?”</p>

<p>“You’re assuming happiness is the ultimate ambition.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. I’m just asking if you would be happier alone.”</p>

<p>Of course it wasn’t the first time she’d confronted the
question, but it was the first time that it had been posed by someone else. It
was the first time she didn’t have the ability to evade it. Would she be
happier alone? I am a mother, she thought—not an answer to the question being
asked, and no more her ultimate ambition than happiness, but her ultimate identity.
She had no lives to compare with her life, no parallel aloneness to measure
against her aloneness. She was simply doing what she thought was the right
thing to do. Living what she thought was the right life.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “I would not be happier alone.”</p>

<p>He ran his finger around a platonically spherical knob and said,
“Then you have it all. Lucky you.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Lucky me. I do feel lucky.”</p>

<p>A long few seconds of touching cold metal in silence, and then
Mark asked, “So?” and placed the knob back on the counter.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“So what’s your news?”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“You said you had news.”</p>

<p>“Oh, right,” she said, shaking her head. “No, it isn’t news.”</p>

<p>And it wasn’t. She and Jacob had been talking about thinking
about looking for a place in the country. Something dinky that could be
reimagined. Not even talking about, really, but allowing the joke to linger for
long enough to become unfunny. It wasn’t news. It was process.</p>

<p>The morning after their night in the Pennsylvania inn, a decade
and a half before, Julia and Jacob went on a hike through a nature preserve. An
unusually chatty welcome sign at the entrance explained that the existing paths
weren’t original but were “desire lines,” shortcuts people took that trampled
the growth and over time appeared deliberate.</p>

<p>Julia and Jacob’s family life became characterized by process,
endless negotiation, tiny adjustments. Maybe we should throw caution to the
wind and take off the window screens this year. Maybe fencing is one activity
too many for Max, and too conspicuously bourgeois for his parents. Maybe if we
replaced the metal spatulas with rubber spatulas, we wouldn’t need to replace
all the nonstick pans that are giving us cancer. Maybe we should get a car with
a third row of seats. Maybe one of those projection things would be nice. Maybe
Sam’s cello teacher was right and he should just be playing songs he loves,
even if that means “Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae).” Maybe more nature is part of the
answer. Maybe having groceries delivered would encourage better cooking, which
would relieve the unnecessary but unshakable guilt of having groceries
delivered.</p>

<p>Their family life was the sum of nudges and corrections.
Infinite tiny increments. News happens in emergency rooms and lawyers’ offices
and, apparently, the Alliance Française. It is to be sought and avoided with
everything one has.</p>

<p>“Let’s look at hardware another day,” Julia said, slipping the
knob into her handbag.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to do the renovation.”</p>

<p>“You’re not?”</p>

<p>“No one even lives there anymore.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Julia. Of course we’ll pay you for—”</p>

<p>“No, right. Of course. I’m just a little slow today.”</p>

<p>“You put in so much work.”</p>

<p>After a snowfall, there are only desire lines. But it always
warms, and even if it takes longer than it should, the snow inevitably melts,
revealing what was chosen.</p>

<p>i don’t care if you cum, but i’ll make you cum anyway</p>

<p>For their tenth anniversary, they went back to the Pennsylvania
inn. They’d stumbled upon it the first time—before GPS, before TripAdvisor,
before the rareness of freedom spoiled freedom.</p>

<p>The anniversary visit involved a week of preparations, which
began with the most difficult task of locating the inn. (Somewhere in Amish
country, quilts on the bedroom walls, red front door, rough-hewn banisters,
wasn’t there a tree-lined drive?) They had to find a night when Irv and Deborah
could stay over to watch the kids, when neither Jacob nor Julia had any
pressing work obligations, when the boys didn’t have anything—teacher
conference, doctor’s visit, performance—that would require parental presence,
and when that specific room was available. The first night to thread all the
needles in the pincushion was three weeks out. Julia didn’t know if that felt
near or far.</p>

<p>Jacob made the reservation, and Julia made the itinerary. They wouldn’t
arrive until sundown, but they would arrive for sundown. The following day,
they would have breakfast at the inn (she called ahead to ask about the menu),
repeat the first half of their hike through the nature preserve, visit the
oldest barn and the third-oldest church in the northeast, check out a few
antiques shops—who knows, maybe find something for the collection.</p>

<p>“Collection?”</p>

<p>“Things with insides larger than their outsides.”</p>

<p>“Great.”</p>

<p>“And then lunch at a small winery I read about on Remodelista.
You’ll note I didn’t mention finding a place for tchotchkes to bring home for
the boys.”</p>

<p>“Noted.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll make it back for a family dinner.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have time for all of that?”</p>

<p>“Better to have too many options,” Julia said.</p>

<p>(They never made it to the antiques shops, because their
vacation’s insides were larger than its outsides.)</p>

<p>As they’d promised themselves, they didn’t write out
instructions for Deborah and Irv, didn’t precook dinner or prepack lunches,
didn’t tell Sam that he would be the “man of the house” while they were gone.
They made clear to everyone that they would not be calling to check in—but
that, of course, should any need arise, they’d have their cell phones close and
charged the whole time.</p>

<p>On the drive up, they talked—not about the kids—until they had
nothing to say. The quiet wasn’t awkward or threatening, but shared,
comfortable, and safe. It was the edge of autumn, as it had been a decade
before, and they drove north along a color spectrum—a few miles farther, a few
degrees colder, a few shades brighter. A decade of autumn.</p>

<p>“Mind if I put on a podcast?” Jacob asked, embarrassed by his
desire for both distraction and Julia’s permission.</p>

<p>“That sounds great,” she said, relieving the embarrassment she
sensed in him, without knowing its source.</p>

<p>A few seconds in, Jacob said, “Ah, I’ve heard this one.”</p>

<p>“So put on another.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s really great. I want you to hear it.”</p>

<p>She put her hand on his hand on the gearshift and said, “You’re
kind,” and the distance from the expected that’s kind to you’re kind was a
kindness.</p>

<p>The podcast began with a description of the 1863 World
Championship of Checkers, at which every game of the forty-game series ended in
a draw and twenty-one of the games were identical, move for move.</p>

<p>“Twenty-one identical games. Every single move.”</p>

<p>“Incredible.”</p>

<p>The problem was that checkers has a relatively limited number of
possible combinations, and since some moves are definitively better than
others, one could know and remember the “ideal” game. The narrator explained
that the term book refers to the sum history of all preceding games. A game is
“in book” when the configuration of the board has occurred before. A game is
“out of book” or “off book” when the configuration is unprecedented. The book
for checkers is relatively small. The 1863 championship demonstrated that
checkers had been, in essence, perfected, and its book memorized. So there was
nothing left besides monotonous repetition, every game a draw.</p>

<p>Chess, however, is almost infinitely complex. There are more
possible chess games than atoms in the universe.</p>

<p>“Think about that. More than atoms in the universe!”</p>

<p>“How could they know how many atoms there are in the universe?”</p>

<p>“Count them, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Think of how many fingers that would take.”</p>

<p>“You make me laugh.”</p>

<p>“Apparently not.”</p>

<p>“On the inside, I am. Silently.”</p>

<p>Jacob slid his five fingers between Julia’s.</p>

<p>The book for chess was created in the sixteenth century, and by
the middle of the twentieth century it occupied an entire library in the Moscow
Chess Club—hundreds of boxes filled with cards documenting every professional
chess game ever played. In the 1980s, chess’s book was put online—many mark
that as the beginning of the end of the game, even if the end would never be
reached. After that, when two players faced each other, they had the ability to
search their opponent’s history: how he responded in different situations, his
strengths and weaknesses, what he would be likely to do.</p>

<p>Access to the book has made whole portions of chess games
checkers-like—sequences that follow an idealized, memorized
pattern—particularly openings. The first sixteen to twenty moves can be
hammered out simply by “reciting” the book. Still, in all but the rarest chess
games a “novelty” is reached—a configuration of pieces that has never been seen
in the history of the universe. In the notation of a chess game, the next move
is marked “out of book.” Both sides are now on their own, without history, no
dead stars to navigate by.</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia arrived at the inn as the sun was dipping below
the horizon, as they had a decade before. “Slow down just a bit,” she’d told
Jacob when they were about twenty minutes away. He thought she wanted to hear
the rest of the podcast, which touched him, but she wanted to give him the same
arrival they’d had last time, which would have touched him if he’d known.</p>

<p>Jacob brought the car almost all the way into the parking space
and left it in neutral. He turned off the stereo and looked at Julia, his wife,
for a long time. Earth’s rotation brought the sun under the horizon, and the
space fully under the car. It was dark: a decade of sunset.</p>

<p>“Nothing has changed,” Jacob said, running his hand along the
drystone wall as they walked the mossy path to the entrance. Jacob wondered, as
he’d wondered ten years before, how the hell such a wall was made.</p>

<p>“I remember everything but us,” Julia said with an audible
laugh.</p>

<p>They checked in, but before taking the duffel to the room, went
to the fire and eased into the coma-inducing leather armchairs that they hadn’t
remembered but then couldn’t stop remembering.</p>

<p>“What did we drink when we sat here last time?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“I actually remember,” Julia said, “because I was so surprised
by your order. Rosé.”</p>

<p>Jacob let out a hearty laugh and asked, “What’s wrong with
rosé?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Julia laughed. “It was just unexpected.”</p>

<p>They ordered two glasses of rosé.</p>

<p>They tried to remember everything about the first visit, every
smallest detail: what was worn (what clothes, what jewelry), what was said
when, what music was playing (if any), what was on the TV over the honesty bar,
what complimentary appetizers were offered, what jokes Jacob told to impress
her, what jokes Jacob told to deflect a conversation he didn’t want to have,
what each had been thinking, who had the courage to nudge the still-new
marriage onto the invisible bridge between where they were (which was
thrilling, but untrustworthy) and where they wanted to be (which would be
thrilling and trustworthy), across a chasm of so much potential hurt.</p>

<p>They ran their hands along the rough-hewn banister of the stairs
to the dining room and had a candlelit dinner, almost all the food sourced from
the property.</p>

<p>“I think it was on that trip that I explained why I don’t fold
my glasses before putting them on the bedside table.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re right.”</p>

<p>Another glass of rosé.</p>

<p>“Remember when you came back from the bathroom and it took you
like twenty minutes to see the note I’d written in butter on your plate?”</p>

<p>“‘You’re my butter half.’”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I really choked. Sorry about that.”</p>

<p>“If we’d been sitting closer to the fire, you might have been
spared.”</p>

<p>“Although hard to explain the puddle. Ah, well. Next time I’ll
do butter.”</p>

<p>“Next time is right now,” she said—an offering and a summoning.</p>

<p>“And I’m supposed to just churn them out?” With a wink: “Churn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I get it.”</p>

<p>“Your stoicism is a butter pill to swallow.”</p>

<p>“So give me something good.”</p>

<p>“I know what you’re thinking: Bad butter puns, how dairy!”</p>

<p>That got a chuckle. She reflexively tried to withhold her
laughter (not from him, but herself) and felt an unexpected desire to reach
across the table and touch him.</p>

<p>“What? You can’t believe it’s not better?”</p>

<p>Another chuckle.</p>

<p>“Butter precedes essence.”</p>

<p>“That one I don’t get. What do you say we move on to bread puns,
or maybe even dialogue?”</p>

<p>“Have I milked it too much?”</p>

<p>“Relent, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Who ya gonna call? Goat’s Butter!”</p>

<p>“Best yet. Definitely the one to end it on.”</p>

<p>“Just to clear the dairy air, I’m the funniest man you’ve ever
known?”</p>

<p>“Only because Benjy isn’t yet a man,” she said, but the
combination of her husband’s overwhelming quickness and his overwhelming need
to be loved brought waves of love, pulled her into its ocean.</p>

<p>“Guns don’t kill people, people kill people. Toasters don’t
toast toast, toast toasts toast.”</p>

<p>“Toasters toast bread.”</p>

<p>“The margarine for error is too small!”</p>

<p>What if she’d given him the love he needed, and she needed to
give, if she’d said, “Your mind is making me want to touch you”?</p>

<p>What if he’d been able to make the right joke at the right time,
or better still, be still?</p>

<p>Another glass of rosé.</p>

<p>“You stole a clock from the desk! I just remembered that!”</p>

<p>“I did not steal a clock.”</p>

<p>“You did,” Julia said. “You totally did.”</p>

<p>The only time in his life he impersonated Nixon: “I am not a
crook!”</p>

<p>“Well, you definitely were. It was a tiny, folding, cheap
nothing. After we made love. You went to the desk, stopped the clock, and put
it in your jacket pocket.”</p>

<p>“Why would I have done that?”</p>

<p>“I think it was supposed to be romantic? Or funny? Or you were
trying to show me your spontaneity credentials? I have no idea. Go back and ask
yourself.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you’re thinking of me? And not some other man? Some
other romantic night at an inn?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never had a romantic night at an inn with anyone else,”
Julia said, which shouldn’t have required saying, and wasn’t true, but she
wanted to care for Jacob, especially right then. Neither knew, only a few steps
onto that invisible bridge, that it never ended, that the rest of their life
together would require steps of trust, which only led to the next step of
trust. She wanted to care for him then, but she wouldn’t always.</p>

<p>They stayed at their table until the waiter, in splutters of
profuse apology, explained that the restaurant was shutting down for the night.</p>

<p>“What was the name of that movie we didn’t watch?”</p>

<p>They would have to go to the room.</p>

<p>Jacob put the duffel on the bed, just as he had. Julia moved it
to the bench at the foot of the bed, just as she had. Jacob removed the
toiletry bag.</p>

<p>Julia said, “I know I shouldn’t, but I wonder what the kids are
doing right now.”</p>

<p>Jacob chuckled. Julia changed into her “fancy” pajamas. Jacob
watched her, unaware of anything that had changed about her body in the decade
since they’d last been there, because he’d seen her body nearly every day
since. He still stole peeks, like a teenager, at her breasts and ass, still
fantasized about what was both real and his. Julia felt herself being watched,
and liked it, so took her time. Jacob changed into boxers and a T-shirt. Julia
went to the sink and ritually craned her neck back, a worn habit, examining
herself as she gently pulled on a lower eyelid—as if she were about to insert a
contact lens. Jacob produced both toothbrushes and applied toothpaste to each,
resting hers, bristles up, on the sink.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Do. Not. Mention. It,” Jacob replied in a funny robot voice
whose utterly random arrival could only have been an expression of anxiety
about the emotions and actions now expected of them. Or so Julia thought.</p>

<p>Jacob brushed his teeth and thought, What if I don’t get hard?
Julia brushed her teeth, searching the mirror for something she didn’t want to
see. Jacob applied five seconds of Old Spice to each armpit (despite being an
inert and sweatless sleeper), washed his face with Cetaphil Daily Facial
Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin (despite having Normal to Dry Skin), then
applied Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Face Lotion, Broad Spectrum SPF
30 (despite the sun having disappeared hours ago, and despite sleeping under a
ceiling). He gave an extra squirt of Eucerin to his trouble spots: around the
alas (a word he knew only from neurotic Google searches—Alas, poor Yorick, the
alas of your missing nose), and between the eyebrows and the tops of the upper
eyelids. Julia’s regimen was more complex: a face wash with S.W. Basics Cleanser,
application of SkinCeuticals Retinol 1.0 Maximum Strength Refining Night Cream,
application of Laneige Water Bank Moisture Cream, gentle tapping application of
Lancôme Rénergie Lift Multi-Action Night cream around her eyes. Jacob went to
the bedroom and did the stretches that everyone in the family made fun of,
despite the chiropractor’s insistence that they were necessary for someone with
such a sedentary lifestyle, and the fact that they actually helped. Julia
flossed with an Oral-B Glide 3D Floss Pick, which, despite being both an
environmental nightmare and a rip-off, spared her from gagging. Jacob returned
to the bathroom and flossed with the cheapest thing he could find at CVS,
string being string.</p>

<p>“You already brushed?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>Jacob said, “Beside you. Just a minute ago.”</p>

<p>Julia made a dollop of hand cream disappear in her palms.</p>

<p>They moved to the bedroom, and Jacob said, “I have to pee,” as
he always did at that moment. He went back into the bathroom, locked the door,
performed his nightly solitary ritual, and flushed the unused toilet to
complete the charade. When he reentered the bedroom, Julia was propped against
the headboard, applying L’Oreal Collagen Re-Plumper Night Cream across the
thigh of her bent leg. Jacob often wanted to tell her that it wasn’t necessary,
that he would love her as she was, just as she would love him; but wanting to
feel attractive was who she was, just as it was who he was, and that, too,
should be loved. Julia tied back her hair.</p>

<p>Jacob touched a tapestry, a depiction of a naval battle beneath
the bannered words “The American Situation: War of 1812,” and said, “Nice.” Did
she remember?</p>

<p>Julia said, “Please tell me not to call the kids.”</p>

<p>“Not to call the kids.”</p>

<p>“Of course I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Or call them. We’re not vacation fundamentalists.”</p>

<p>Julia laughed.</p>

<p>Jacob was never immune to her laughter.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, patting the bed beside her.</p>

<p>Jacob said, “We have a big day tomorrow,” illuminating several
emergency exit paths at once: they needed rest; tomorrow was more important
than tonight; it wouldn’t be a disappointment if she acknowledged her
tiredness.</p>

<p>“You must be beat,” Julia said, redirecting things slightly by
putting the onus on him.</p>

<p>“I am,” he said, almost as a question, almost accepting his
role. “And you must be, too,” asking her to accept hers.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, “hold me.”</p>

<p>Jacob turned off the lights, placed his unfolded glasses on the
bedside table, and got into bed, beside his wife of a decade. She turned onto
her side, bringing her head into her husband’s armpit. He kissed the North Pole
of her head. Now they were on their own, without history, no dead stars to
navigate by.</p>

<p>If they’d said what they were thinking, Jacob would have said,
“To be honest, it’s not as nice as I remembered.”</p>

<p>And she would have said, “It couldn’t have been.”</p>

<p>“When I was a boy, I used to ride my bike down a hill behind the
house. I’d narrate each run. You know, ‘Jacob Bloch, set to attempt a new land
speed record. He grips his handlebars. Can he do it?’ I called it ‘The Huge
Hill.’ More than anything else in my childhood, it made me feel brave. I went
back the other day. It was on the way to a meeting, and I had a few minutes. I
couldn’t find it. I found where it was, or should have been, but it wasn’t
there. Only the gentlest slope.”</p>

<p>“You grew,” she would have said.</p>

<p>If they’d said what they were thinking, Jacob would have said,
“I’m thinking about how we’re not having sex. Are you?”</p>

<p>And without defensiveness or hurt, Julia would have said, “Yeah,
I am.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing I’m asking you to say here. I promise. I just
want to tell you where I am. OK?”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>And risking another step onto the invisible bridge, Jacob would
have said, “I’m worrying that you don’t want to have sex with me. That you
don’t desire me.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to worry,” Julia would have said as she would
have brought her hand to the side of his face.</p>

<p>“I always desire you,” he would have said. “I was watching you
undress—”</p>

<p>“I know. I felt it.”</p>

<p>“You look every bit as beautiful as you did ten years ago.”</p>

<p>“That’s plainly untrue. But thank you.”</p>

<p>“It’s true to me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>And Jacob would have found himself in the middle of the
invisible bridge, above the chasm of potential hurt, at the farthest point from
safety: “Why do you think we aren’t having sex?”</p>

<p>And Julia would have stood beside him and, without looking down,
said, “Maybe because the expectation is so great?”</p>

<p>“Could be. And we’re genuinely tired.”</p>

<p>“I know I am.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to say something that isn’t easy to say.”</p>

<p>“You’re safe,” she would have promised.</p>

<p>He would have turned to her and said, “We never talk about how I
can’t get hard sometimes. Do you ever think it’s you?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for saying that.”</p>

<p>“Julia,” he would have said, “it isn’t you.”</p>

<p>But he didn’t say anything, and neither did she. Not because the
words were deliberately withheld, but because the pipeline between them was too
occluded for such bravery. Too many small accumulations: wrong words, absences
of words, imposed quiet, plausibly deniable attacks on known vulnerabilities,
mentions of things that needn’t be mentioned, misunderstandings and accidents,
moments of weakness, tiny acts of shitty retribution for tiny acts of shitty
retribution for tiny acts of shitty retribution for an original offense that no
one could remember. Or for no offense at all.</p>

<p>They didn’t recede from each other that night. They didn’t roll
to opposite sides of the bed, or withdraw into two silences. They held each
other and shared a silence in the darkness. But it was silence. Neither
suggested they explore the room with their eyes closed, as they’d done the last
time they were there. They explored the room independently, in their minds,
beside each other. And in Jacob’s jacket pocket was the stopped clock—a decade
of 1:43—which he’d been waiting for just the right moment to reveal.</p>

<p>i’ll keep making you cum after you beg me to stop</p>

<p>In the hardware gallery parking lot, she sat in her car—her
Volvo like everybody else’s, in a color she knew was wrong the second after it
was impossible to change her mind—not knowing what to do with herself, knowing
only that she had to do something. She wasn’t sufficiently adept with her phone
to waste the kind of time she needed to waste. But she could squander at least
a little. She found the company that made her favorite architectural model
trees. They weren’t the most realistic, they weren’t even well made. She didn’t
like them because they evoked trees but because they evoked the sadness that
trees evoke—the way an out-of-focus photograph might best capture its subject’s
essence. It was extremely unlikely that the manufacturer intended any of that,
but it was possible, and it didn’t matter.</p>

<p>They were featuring a new line of autumn trees. Who could be the
market for such things? Orange Maple, Red Maple, Yellow Maple, Autumn Sycamore,
Light Orange Aspen, Yellowing Aspen, Turning Maple, Turning Sycamore. She
imagined a tiny, younger Jacob, and a tiny, younger Julia, in a tiny, scratched
and dinged Saab, driving shoelace roads bordered by an infinity of tiny,
turning trees, under an infinity of tiny, massive stars, and like the trees,
the tiny young couple weren’t realistic, or well made, and they didn’t evoke
their bigger, older selves, but they evoked the sadness that they would grow to
evoke.</p>

<p>Mark tapped her window. She tried rolling it down and realized
the car needed to be on, but the key wasn’t in the ignition or in her hand, and
she didn’t have it in her to go through her bag, so she clumsily opened the
door.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you at the Model UN trip.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“In a couple of weeks. I’m the male chaperone.”</p>

<p>“Oh. I didn’t know that.”</p>

<p>“So we can continue our talk then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how much more there is to say.”</p>

<p>“There’s always more to say.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes not.”</p>

<p>And then, on her day off, wanting only to get as far away from
her life as possible, she found herself trampling a desire line home.</p>

<p>it’s enough when i say it’s enough</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>HERE I AMN’T</h2>

<p>&gt; Anyone know how to take a picture of stars?</p>

<p>&gt; Like in the sky, or with their hands in wet sidewalk?</p>

<p>&gt; My phone’s flash makes everything white. I turned it off,
but the shutter stays open for so long my tiny movements blur everything. I
tried bracing my arm with my other hand, but it was still a blur.</p>

<p>&gt; Phones are useless at night.</p>

<p>&gt; Unless you need to go down a dark hallway.</p>

<p>&gt; My phone is dying.</p>

<p>&gt; Or call someone.</p>

<p>&gt; Just try to make it comfortable.</p>

<p>&gt; Samanta, this place is fucking lit!</p>

<p>&gt; Insane.</p>

<p>&gt; Where are you that there are stars out?</p>

<p>&gt; The guy told me there was nothing wrong with it. I said,
“If there’s nothing wrong with it, why is it broken?” And he said, “Why is it
broken if there’s nothing wrong with it?” And I tried, again, to show him, but
of course it worked again. I almost cried, or killed him.</p>

<p>&gt; What happens at a bat mitzvah, anyway?</p>

<p>At any given time, there are forty times in the world. Another
interesting fact: China used to have five time zones, but now it has only one,
and for some Chinese people the sun doesn’t rise until after ten. Another: long
before man traveled into space, rabbis debated how one would observe Shabbat
there—not because they anticipated space travel but because Buddhists strive to
live with questions and Jews would rather die. On Earth, the sun rises and sets
once each day. A spaceship orbits Earth once every ninety minutes, which would
require a Shabbat every nine hours. One line of thinking held that Jews simply
shouldn’t be in a place that raises doubts about prayer and observance.
Another, that one’s earthly obligations are earthbound—what happens in space
stays in space. Some argued that a Jewish astronaut should observe the same
routine he would on Earth. Others, that Shabbat should be observed by the time
set on his instruments, despite the city of Houston being about as Jewish as
the Rockets’ locker room. Two Jewish astronauts have died in space. No Jewish astronaut
has observed Shabbat.</p>

<p>Sam’s dad gave him an article about Ilan Ramon, the only Israeli
ever to go into space. Before leaving, Ramon went to the Holocaust Museum, to
find an artifact to take with him. He chose a drawing of Earth by a young,
anonymous boy who died in the war.</p>

<p>“Imagine that sweet child scribbling away,” Sam’s dad said. “If
an angel had landed on his shoulder and told him, ‘You’re going to be killed
before your next birthday, and in sixty years a representative of the Jewish
state is going to carry your drawing of Earth as seen from space into space—”</p>

<p>“If there were angels,” Sam said, “he wouldn’t have been
killed.”</p>

<p>“If the angels were good angels.”</p>

<p>“Do we believe in bad angels?”</p>

<p>“We probably don’t believe in any angels.”</p>

<p>Sam enjoyed knowledge. The accumulation and distribution of
facts gave him a feeling of control, of utility, of the opposite of the
powerlessness that comes with having a smallish, underdeveloped body that
doesn’t dependably respond to the mental commands of a largish, overstimulated
brain.</p>

<p>It was always dusk in Other Life, so once every day the “other
time” corresponded to the “real time” of its citizens. Some referred to that
moment as “The Harmony.” Some wouldn’t miss it. Some didn’t like to be at their
screens when it happened. Sam’s bar mitzvah was still a ways off. Samanta’s bat
mitzvah was today. Did the drawing simply immolate when the space shuttle
exploded? Are any small pieces of it still orbiting? Did they fall to the
water, descend, over hours, to the ocean floor, and veil one of those deep-sea
creatures that are so alien they look like they came from outer space?</p>

<p>The pews were filled with everyone Samanta knew, people Sam had
never met. They came from Kyoto, Lisbon, Sacramento, Lagos, Toronto, Oklahoma
City, and Beirut. Twenty-seven dusks. They were sitting together in the virtual
sanctuary of Sam’s creation—they saw the beauty; Sam saw all that was wrong
with it, all that was wrong with him. They came for Samanta, a community of her
communities. As far as they knew, it was a happy occasion.</p>

<p>&gt; Just take it to someone else. Insist that they open it up.</p>

<p>&gt; Just fucking throw your phone from a bridge.</p>

<p>&gt; Can someone explain to me what’s going to happen here?</p>

<p>&gt; Funnily enough, I’m crossing a bridge right now, but I’m on
an Amtrak and you can’t open the windows.</p>

<p>&gt; Send us a picture of the water.</p>

<p>&gt; Today Samanta becomes a woman.</p>

<p>&gt; There’s more than one way to open a window.</p>

<p>&gt; She’s having her period?</p>

<p>&gt; Imagine thousands of phones washed up on the beach.</p>

<p>&gt; Love letters in digital bottles.</p>

<p>&gt; Why imagine? Go to India.</p>

<p>&gt; Today she’s becoming a Jewish woman.</p>

<p>&gt; I’m on an Amtrak, too!</p>

<p>&gt; A Jewish woman how?</p>

<p>&gt; More like hate mail.</p>

<p>&gt; Let’s not figure out if we’re on the same train, OK?</p>

<p>&gt; Israel is the fucking worst.</p>

<p>&gt; Wiki: “When a girl reaches 12 years old she becomes ‘bat
mitzvah’—daughter of commandment—and is recognized by Jewish tradition as
having the same rights as an adult. She is now morally and ethically
responsible for her decisions and actions.”</p>

<p>&gt; Set your camera’s phone on timer and then rest it on the
ground, facing up.</p>

<p>&gt; Jewish people are the worst.</p>

<p>&gt; Knock knock.</p>

<p>&gt; Why would you even want to take a picture of stars?</p>

<p>&gt; Who’s there?</p>

<p>&gt; To remember them.</p>

<p>&gt; Not six million Jews!</p>

<p>&gt;?</p>

<p>&gt; Dying laughing.</p>

<p>&gt; Anti-Semite!</p>

<p>&gt; Dying, anyway.</p>

<p>&gt; I’m Jewish!</p>

<p>No one ever asked Sam why he took a Latina as an avatar, because
no one, other than Max, knew that he had. The choice might have seemed odd.
Some might even have thought it was offensive. They would be wrong. Being Sam
was odd and offensive. Having such prolific salivary and sweat glands. Being
unable not to think about walking while walking. Backne and buttne. There was
no experience more humiliating or existentially dispiriting than shopping for
clothes. But how to explain to his mom that he would rather have nothing that
properly fit than have it confirmed to him, in a mirrored torture chamber, that
nothing ever would fit? Sleeves would never end at the right place. Collars
would never not be too pointy, or rise too high, or angle improperly. The
buttons of every button-down shirt would always be spaced such that the
penultimate one from the top made the neck opening either too constrictive or
too revealing. There was a point—literally a single location in space—where a
button might be positioned to create the natural feel and effect. But no shirt
had ever been made with such button placement, probably because no one’s
upper-body proportions were as disproportionate as his.</p>

<p>Because his parents were technological fucktards, Sam knew that
they periodically checked his search history, the regular sweeping of which
only rubbed his blackheaded nose in the patheticness of being a preteen with a
Y chromosome who watched button-sewing tutorials on YouTube. And in those
evenings behind his locked bedroom door, when his parents worried that he was
researching firearms, or bisexuality, or Islam, he took to moving the
penultimate buttons and slits of his loathsome shirts to the only endurable
position. Half the things he did were stereotypically gay. In fact, probably a
far greater proportion, if you were to remove the activities, such as walking
an average-size dog and sleeping, that had no quality of straightness or
gayness. He didn’t care. He had not even the smallest issue with gay people,
not even aesthetically. But he would have liked to correct the record, because
he had the largest of all issues with being misunderstood.</p>

<p>One morning at breakfast, his mom asked if he’d been removing
and resewing the buttons on his shirts. He denied it with nonchalant vehemence.</p>

<p>She said, “I think it’s neat.”</p>

<p>And so from then on, the upper half of his daily, all-seasons
uniform shifted to American Apparel T-shirts, even though they broadcast the
tits mysteriously sprouting from his otherwise collapsed torso.</p>

<p>It felt odd to have hair that never once, despite repeated and
generous applications of product, rested properly. It felt odd to walk, and he
often found himself slipping into an over- (or under-) stylized catwalk stride,
whereby he swung his ass out to each side and pounded his feet into the ground
as if trying not only to kill insects but to perpetrate an insect genocide. Why
did he walk like that? Because he wanted to walk like nothing, and the extreme
effort to do so generated a horrible spectacle of horrible perambulation by
someone who was such a human cowlick he actually used the word perambulation.
It felt odd to have to sit in chairs, to have to make eye contact, to have to
speak with a voice that he knew to be his own but did not recognize, or only recognized
as belonging to yet another self-appointed Wikipedia sheriff who would never
possess a biographical entry visited, much less edited, by someone who wasn’t
him.</p>

<p>He assumed that there were times, other than while masturbating,
when he felt at home in his body, but he couldn’t remember them—maybe before he
smashed his fingers? Samanta wasn’t his first Other Life avatar, but she was
the first whose logarithmic skin fit. He never had to explain the choice to
anyone else—Max was wide-eyed or righteous enough not to care—but how did he
explain it to himself? He didn’t wish he were a girl. He didn’t wish he were a
Latina. Then again, he didn’t not wish he were a Latina girl. Despite the
near-constant regret he felt about being himself, he never confused himself for
the problem. The problem was the world. It was the world that didn’t fit. But
how much happiness has ever resulted from correcting the record on the
culpability of the world?</p>

<p>&gt; I was up until 3:00, cruising the Google Street View of my
neighborhood, and I saw myself.</p>

<p>&gt; Is there going to be some sort of party after this?</p>

<p>&gt; Does anyone know how to manipulate a PDF? I’m too lazy to
figure it out.</p>

<p>&gt; My celebrity memoir title: It Was the Worst of Times, It
Was the Worst of Times.</p>

<p>&gt; What kind of PDF?</p>

<p>&gt; We’re going to run out of maple syrup in three years?</p>

<p>&gt; Is this going to be in Hebrew? If so, can someone less lazy
than me write a script to stream it through a translator?</p>

<p>&gt; I read that, too.</p>

<p>&gt; Why do I find it so incredibly sad?</p>

<p>&gt; Anyone have a NexTek thumb drive?</p>

<p>&gt; Because you love waffles.</p>

<p>&gt; My celebrity memoir title: “I Did It Your Way.”</p>

<p>&gt; I skipped right over the article about Syrian refugees. I
know that shit is horrible, and I know it in theory makes me sad, but I can’t
find a way to have an actual emotion about it. But the syrup made me want to
hide under my bed.</p>

<p>&gt; They only work for a few weeks.</p>

<p>&gt; So hide and cry your maple tears.</p>

<p>&gt; Samanta, I got you something you’re going to love, if you
don’t already have it, which you probably do. Anyway, transferring now.</p>

<p>&gt; I can hear the most beautiful song coming from the
earphones of the girl sitting across the aisle from me.</p>

<p>&gt; Today’s most-watched: some kids in Russia with a homemade
bungee jump, an alligator biting an electric eel, an old Korean grocer beating
the shit out of a burglar, quintuplets laughing, two black girls beating the
shit out of each other on a playground …</p>

<p>&gt; What song?</p>

<p>&gt; I want to do something massive, but what?</p>

<p>&gt; Forget it, I figured it out.</p>

<p>&gt; Shit, I didn’t know you’re supposed to bring a gift to a
bat mitzvah.</p>

<p>&gt; Transfer is taking forever.</p>

<p>Sam thought about texting Billie, seeing if she might want to
join him at a modern dance performance (or show, or whatever they’re called) on
Saturday. It sounded cool, as she’d written about it in her diary, which he’d
removed from her unattended backpack while she was in gym, concealed behind his
far larger, far less interesting chemistry textbook, and perused—a word that
means the exact opposite of what most people think it means. He didn’t like texting,
because he had to look at his thumb—the finger that got it worst, or healed
least well. The one people tried not to notice. Weeks after the other fingers
had regained their color and approximate shape, the thumb was black, and askew
at the knuckle. The doctor said it wasn’t taking, and would have to be
amputated to protect the rest of the hand from infection. He said this in front
of Sam. Sam’s dad said, “You’re sure?” His mom insisted they get another
opinion. The second opinion was the same, and his dad sighed, and his mom
insisted they get another. The third doctor said there was no immediate risk of
infection, and kids are almost superhumanly resilient, and “almost always these
things just find a way to heal themselves.” His dad didn’t trust the sound of
that, but his mom did, and within two weeks, the darkness was receding toward
the thumb’s tip. Sam was nearly eight. He doesn’t remember any of the doctors,
or even the physical therapy. He barely remembers the accident itself, and
sometimes wonders if he’s just remembering his parents’ memories.</p>

<p>Sam doesn’t remember screaming, “Why did that happen?” as loud
as he could, not out of terror, or anger, or confusion, but because of the size
of the question. There are stories of mothers lifting cars off their trapped
children, he remembers that, but he doesn’t remember his mom’s superhuman
composure when she met his wild eyes and subdued them, promising, “I love you,
and I’m here.” He doesn’t remember being pinned while the doctor reattached the
ends of his fingers. He doesn’t remember waking up from his five-hour
post-surgery nap to find that his dad had filled his room with the contents of
Child’s Play. But he remembers the game they used to play when he was a child:
Where is Thumbkin? Where is Thumbkin? Here I am! Here I am! They never played
it with Benjy after the injury, not once, and never once acknowledged that they
had stopped playing it. His parents were trying to spare Sam, not understanding
that the shame suggested by the silence was the one thing he could have been
spared.</p>

<p>&gt; Here’s an app that should exist: You point your phone at
something and it streams video of what that thing looked like a few seconds
before. (Obviously this would depend on pretty much everyone filming and
uploading pretty much everything pretty much always, but we’re already pretty
much there.) So you would be experiencing the world as it just happened.</p>

<p>&gt; Cool idea. And you could change settings to increase the
lag.</p>

<p>&gt;?</p>

<p>&gt; You could see the world of yesterday, or a month ago, or
your birthday, or—and this won’t be possible until the future, once enough
video has been uploaded—people could move around their childhoods.</p>

<p>&gt; Imagine a dying person, who hasn’t yet been born, one day
walking through his childhood home.</p>

<p>&gt; What if it had been torn down?</p>

<p>&gt; And there would be ghosts, too.</p>

<p>&gt; Ghosts how?</p>

<p>&gt; “A dying person who hasn’t yet been born.”</p>

<p>&gt; Is this thing ever gonna start?</p>

<p>Sam was brought back to the other side of the screen by a
knocking.</p>

<p>“Go away.”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>“What?” he asked, opening the door for Max.</p>

<p>“Just going away.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“A plate of food.”</p>

<p>“No it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Toast is food.”</p>

<p>“Why the hell would I want toast?”</p>

<p>“To plug your ears?”</p>

<p>Sam gestured for Max to come into the room.</p>

<p>“They’re talking about me?”</p>

<p>“Oh yeah.”</p>

<p>“Bad things?”</p>

<p>“They definitely aren’t singing ‘For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow,’
or whatever.”</p>

<p>“Is Dad disappointed?”</p>

<p>“I’d say so.”</p>

<p>Sam went back to his screen, while Max nonchalantly tried to
absorb the details of his brother’s room.</p>

<p>“In me?” Sam asked without turning to face his brother.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Disappointed in me?”</p>

<p>“I thought that’s what you meant.”</p>

<p>“He can be such a pussy.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but Mom can be such a dick.”</p>

<p>Sam laughed. “Absolutely true.” He logged off and spun to face
Max. “They’re peeling off the Band-Aid so slowly, new hairs have time to grow
and get stuck to it.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“I wish they’d just get divorced already.”</p>

<p>“Divorced?” Max asked, his body rerouting blood to the part of
the brain that conceals panic.</p>

<p>“Obviously.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“What are you, ignorant?”</p>

<p>“Is that like stupid?”</p>

<p>“Not-knowing.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“So,” Sam asked, running his finger around the frame of his
iPad, around the rectangular tear in the physical world, “who would you
choose?”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“Choose. To live with.”</p>

<p>Max didn’t like this.</p>

<p>“Don’t kids just, like, split time, or whatever?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, it would begin like that, but then, you know, it always
becomes a choice.”</p>

<p>Max hated this.</p>

<p>“I guess Dad’s more fun,” he said. “And I’d get in trouble a lot
less. And probably have more cool stuff and screen time—”</p>

<p>“To enjoy before you die of scurvy, or melanoma from never
putting on sunscreen, or just get sent to jail for getting to school late every
single day.”</p>

<p>“Do they send you to jail for that?”</p>

<p>“It’s definitely the law that you have to go.”</p>

<p>“I’d also miss Mom.”</p>

<p>“What about her?”</p>

<p>“That she’s her.”</p>

<p>Sam didn’t like this.</p>

<p>“But I’d miss Dad if I went with Mom,” Max said, “so, I guess I
don’t know. Who would you choose?”</p>

<p>“For you?”</p>

<p>“For yourself. I’d just want to be where you are.”</p>

<p>Sam hated this.</p>

<p>Max tilted his head up and looked at the ceiling, encouraging
the tears to roll back under his eyes. It appeared almost robotic, but his
inability to directly face such direct human emotion was what made him human.
Or at least his father’s son.</p>

<p>Max put his hands in his pockets—a Jolly Rancher wrapper, a
stubby pencil from a mini golf outing, a receipt whose type had vanished—and
said, “So I went to a zoo once.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been to the zoo a lot of times.”</p>

<p>“It’s a joke.”</p>

<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>“So I went to a zoo once, because I’d heard it was like the greatest
zoo in the world. And, you know, I wanted to see it for myself.”</p>

<p>“Must have been pretty spectacular.”</p>

<p>“Well, the weird thing is, there was only one animal in the
entire zoo.”</p>

<p>“No kidding.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. And it was a dog.”</p>

<p>“Argus?”</p>

<p>“You just screwed up my timing.”</p>

<p>“Do the last line again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just start from the beginning.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“So I went to a zoo once, because I’d heard it was the greatest
zoo in the world. But the thing is, there was only one animal in the entire
zoo. And it was a dog.”</p>

<p>“Jeez!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, turns out it was a shih tzu. Get it?”</p>

<p>“Really funny,” Sam said, unable to laugh, despite finding it
genuinely really funny.</p>

<p>“You get it, though, right? Shih tzu?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Shih. Tzu.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Max.”</p>

<p>“Am I being annoying?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Just the opposite.”</p>

<p>“What’s the opposite of annoying?”</p>

<p>Sam tilted his head up, darted his eyes toward the ceiling, and
said, “Thanks for not asking if I did it.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Max said, rubbing the erased receipt between his thumb and
forefinger. “It’s because I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“I know. You’re the only one who doesn’t care.”</p>

<p>“Turns out it was a shit family,” Max said, wondering where he
would go after leaving the room.</p>

<p>“That’s not funny.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t get it.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>EPITOME</h2>

<p>“Dad?” Benjy said, entering the kitchen yet again, his
grandmother in tow. He always said Dad with a question mark, as if asking where
his father was.</p>

<p>“Yeah, buddy?”</p>

<p>“When you made dinner last night, my broccoli was touching my
chicken.”</p>

<p>“And you were just thinking about that?”</p>

<p>“No. All day.”</p>

<p>“It mixes in your stomach anyway,” Max said from the threshold.</p>

<p>“Where’d you come from?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“Mom’s vagina hole,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“And you’re going to die anyway,” Max continued, “so who cares
what touches the chicken, which is dead anyway.”</p>

<p>Benjy turned to Jacob: “Is that true, Dad?”</p>

<p>“Which part?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to die?”</p>

<p>“Why, Max? In what way was this necessary?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to die!”</p>

<p>“Many, many years from now.”</p>

<p>“Does that really make a difference?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“It could be worse,” Irv said. “You could be Argus.”</p>

<p>“Why would it be worse to be Argus?”</p>

<p>“You know, one paw in the oven.”</p>

<p>Benjy let out a plaintive wail, and then, as if carried on a
light beam from wherever she’d been, Julia opened the door and rushed in.</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“What are you doing back?” Jacob asked, hating everything about
the moment.</p>

<p>“Dad says I’m gonna die.”</p>

<p>“In fact,” Jacob said with a forced laugh, “what I said was,
you’re going to live a very, very, very long life.”</p>

<p>Julia brought Benjy onto her lap and said, “Of course you aren’t
going to die.”</p>

<p>“Then make that two frozen burritos,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“Hi, darling,” Deborah said to Julia. “It was beginning to feel
a bit estrogen-starved in here.”</p>

<p>“Why did I get a boo-boo, Mama?”</p>

<p>“You don’t have a boo-boo,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“On my knee,” Benjy said, pointing at nothing. “There.”</p>

<p>“You must have fallen,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“There is literally no boo-boo.”</p>

<p>“Because falling is part of life,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“It’s the epitome of life,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Nice vocab, Max.”</p>

<p>“Epitome?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“Essence of,” Deborah said.</p>

<p>“Why is falling the epitome of life?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“The earth is always falling toward the sun,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Why?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“Because of gravity,” Max said.</p>

<p>“No,” Benjy said, addressing his question to Jacob. “Why isn’t
falling the epitome of life?”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I understand your question.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why am I not sure that I understand your question?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that.”</p>

<p>“Because this conversation has become confusing, and because I’m
just a human with severely limited intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Jacob.”</p>

<p>“I’m dying!”</p>

<p>“You’re overreacting.”</p>

<p>“No I amn’t!”</p>

<p>“No you aren’t.”</p>

<p>“I amn’t.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t, Benjy.”</p>

<p>Deborah: “Kiss it, Jacob.”</p>

<p>Jacob kissed Benjy’s nonexistent boo-boo.</p>

<p>“I can carry our refrigerator,” Benjy said, not quite sure if he
was ready to be done with his crying.</p>

<p>“That’s wonderful,” Deborah said.</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Max said of course I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Give the kid a break,” Jacob whispered to Max at conversational
volume. “If he says he can lift the fridge, he can lift the fridge.”</p>

<p>“I can carry it far away.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it from here,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“I can control the microwave with my mind,” Max said.</p>

<p>“No way,” Jacob said to Julia, too casually to be believable.
“We’re doing great. We’ve been having a great time. You walked in at a bad
moment. Unrepresentative. But everything is cool, and this is your day.”</p>

<p>“Off from what?” Benjy asked his mother.</p>

<p>“What?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>“What do you need a day off from?”</p>

<p>“Who said I needed a day off?”</p>

<p>“Dad just did.”</p>

<p>“I said we were giving you a day off.”</p>

<p>“Off from what?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“Us, obviously,” Max said.</p>

<p>So much sublimation: domestic closeness had become intimate
distance, intimate distance had become shame, shame had become resignation,
resignation had become fear, fear had become resentment, resentment had become
self-protection. Julia often thought that if they could just trace the string
back to the source of their withholding, they might actually find their
openness. Was it Sam’s injury? The never-asked question of how it happened? She’d
always assumed they were protecting each other with that silence, but what if
they were trying to injure, to transfer the wound from Sam to themselves? Or
was it older? Did the withholding from each other predate meeting each other?
Believing that would change everything.</p>

<p>The resentment that was fear, that was resignation, that was
shame, that was distance, that was closeness, was too heavy to carry all day,
every day. So where to put it down? On the kids, of course. Jacob and Julia
were both guilty, but Jacob was guiltier. He’d become increasingly snippy with
them, because he knew they would take it. He pushed, because they wouldn’t push
back. He was afraid of Julia, but he wasn’t afraid of them, so he gave them
what was hers.</p>

<p>“Enough!” he said to Max, his voice rising to a growl. “Enough.”</p>

<p>“Enough yourself,” Max said.</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia met eyes, registering that first act of talking
back.</p>

<p>“Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>Jacob let it rip: “I’m not discussing things with you, Max. I’m
tired of discussion. We discuss too much in this family.”</p>

<p>“Who’s discussing?” Max asked.</p>

<p>Deborah went to her son and said, “Take a breath, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“I take too many breaths.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go upstairs for a second,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“No. That’s what we do with them. Not what you do with me.” Then,
turning back to Max: “Sometimes, in life, in a family, you have to just do the
right thing without endlessly parsing and negotiating. You get with the
program.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, get with the pogrom,” Irv said, imitating his son.</p>

<p>“Dad, just stop. OK?”</p>

<p>“I can lift the whole kitchen,” Benjy said, touching his
father’s arm.</p>

<p>“Kitchens aren’t liftable,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“They are.”</p>

<p>“No, Benjy. They are not.”</p>

<p>“You’re so strong,” Julia said, her fingers wrapped around each
of Benjy’s wrists.</p>

<p>“Immolated,” Benjy said. And then, in a whisper: “I can lift our
kitchen.”</p>

<p>Max looked to his mother. She closed her eyes, unwilling or
unable to protect him as she did his little brother.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>A godsent dogfight on the street brought everyone to the window.
It wasn’t actually a fight, just two dogs barking at a smug squirrel on a
branch. Still, godsent. By the time the family reassumed positions in the
kitchen, the previous ten minutes felt ten years old.</p>

<p>Julia excused herself and went up to the shower. She never
showered in the middle of the day, and was surprised by the force of the hand
that guided her there. She could hear sound effects coming from Sam’s room—he
was obviously ignoring the first commandment of his exile—but she didn’t stop.</p>

<p>She closed and locked the door of the bathroom, put down her
bag, undressed, and examined herself in the mirror. Reaching her arm to the
sky, she could follow a vein as it traversed the underside of her right breast.
Her chest had sunk, her belly had protruded. These things had happened in tiny,
imperceptible increments. The wisps of pubic hair reaching to her belly had
darkened—the skin itself seemed to have. None of it was news, but process. She
had observed, and felt, the unwanted renovation of her body, at least since Sam
was born: the expansion and ultimate shrinking of her breasts, the settling and
pockmarking of her thighs, the relaxing of all that was firm. Jacob had told
her, on their second visit to the inn, and on other occasions, that he loved
her body exactly as it was. But despite believing him, some nights she felt a
need to apologize to him.</p>

<p>And then she remembered it. Of course she did: it was put there
for her to remember at this moment. She didn’t know it at the time. She didn’t
know why she, who had never stolen anything in her life, was stealing. This was
why.</p>

<p>She raised one foot onto the sink and held the doorknob to her
mouth, warming and wetting it with her breathing. She parted the lips of her
pussy and pressed it there, gentle at first, then less so, starting to spin the
knob. She felt the first wave of something good go through her, and her legs
weakened. She squatted, pulled down the neck of her shirt, and exposed one
breast. Then she re-wet the knob with her tongue and found its place between
her lips again, pressing tiny circles against her clit, then just tapping it
there, liking how the warm metal began to stick to her skin, to pull at it a
little each time.</p>

<p>She was on her hands and knees. No. She was standing. Where was
she? Outside. Yes. Leaning against her car. In a parking lot. In a field. No,
bent, the top half of her body across the car’s backseat, her feet on the
earth. Her pants and underwear were pulled down only far enough to expose her
ass. She pressed her face into the seat and pushed her ass out. She spread her
legs as wide as the pants would allow. She wanted them held together. She
wanted it to be difficult. They could be discovered at any moment. You have to
be fast, she told him. Him? Just fuck me hard. It was Jacob. Just make me come.
Just fuck me how you want, Jacob, and walk away. Just leave me here with your
cum dripping down my thighs. Fuck me and go. No. It shifted. Now she was in the
bespoke hardware showroom. No men. Only doorknobs. She ground the knob into her
clit, licked three fingers, and slid them inside to feel the contractions as
she came.</p>

<p>She felt a sudden thud, like the violent landing that would
sometimes jerk her from near-sleep. But it wasn’t that—she wasn’t crashing onto
the floor; something was crashing onto her. What the hell was going on? Had too
much blood rushed to her waist too quickly, causing some kind of neurological
event? Masturbation was about mental exertion, but she was suddenly at the
mercy of her mind.</p>

<p>Through the ceiling of her pine coffin she could see Sam
standing above her, so handsome in his suit, a shovel in hand. She didn’t
choose this. It didn’t bring her pleasure. What a beautiful boy. What a
beautiful man. It’s OK, love. OK, OK, OK. She moaned, and he wailed, both of
them animals. He scooped another shovelful of dirt and tipped it onto her. So
this is what it’s like. Now I know, and nothing will be different.</p>

<p>And then Sam left.</p>

<p>And Jacob and Max and Benjy left.</p>

<p>All her men left.</p>

<p>And then more dirt, this time from the shovels of strangers,
four at a time.</p>

<p>And then they left.</p>

<p>And she was alone, in the tiniest house of her life.</p>

<p>She was brought back to the world, back to life, by a buzzing—it
shook her free from her unchosen fantasy, and she was hit by the full absurdity
of what she was doing. Who did she think she was? Her in-laws downstairs, her
son down the hall, her IRA bigger than her savings account. She didn’t feel
ashamed; she felt stupid.</p>

<p>Another buzz.</p>

<p>She couldn’t place its source.</p>

<p>It was a phone, but not a buzz she’d ever heard before.</p>

<p>Did Jacob get Sam a smartphone to replace the hand-me-down flip
phone on which he’d been texting at Joseph Mitchell speed for the last year?
They’d discussed the possibility of doing so for his bar mitzvah, but that was
still weeks off, and before Sam had gotten into trouble, and anyway, they’d
rejected the idea. Too much already pulling everyone too far into the noisy
elsewhere. The experiment with Other Life had all but kidnapped Sam’s
consciousness.</p>

<p>She heard the buzz.</p>

<p>She searched the wicker basket full of toiletry odds and ends,
the medicine cabinet: small and huge bottles of Advil, nail polish remover,
organic tampons, Aquaphor, hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, Benadryl,
Neosporin, Polysporin, children’s ibuprofen, Sudafed, Purell, Imodium, Colace,
amoxicillin, aspirin, triamcinolone acetonide cream, lidocaine cream,
Dermoplast spray, Debrox drops, saline solution, Bactroban cream, floss,
vitamin E lotion … all the things bodies might have a need for. When did bodies
develop so many needs? For so many years she needed nothing.</p>

<p>She heard the buzz.</p>

<p>Where was it? She might have been able to convince herself that
it was coming from the neighbors’, on the other side of the wall, or even that
she’d imagined it, but it buzzed again, and this time she could place the sound
in the corner, by the floor.</p>

<p>She got on her hands and knees. In the basket of magazines?
Behind the toilet? She reached her hand around the bowl, and no sooner had she
touched it than it buzzed again, as if touching her back. Whose phone was this?
One final buzz: a missed call from JULIA.</p>

<p>Julia?</p>

<p>But she was Julia.</p>

<p>what happened to you?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>T-H-I-S-2-S-H-A-L-L-N-’-T-P-A-S-S</h2>

<p>Sam knew that everything would collapse, he just didn’t know
exactly how or when. His parents were going to get divorced and ultimately hate
each other and spread destruction like that Japanese reactor. That much was
clear, if not to them. He tried not to notice their lives, but it was
impossible to ignore how often his dad fell asleep in front of the absence of
news, how often his mom retreated into pruning the trees of her architectural
models, how his dad started serving dessert every night, how his mom told Argus
she “needed space” whenever he licked her, how devoted his mom had become to
the Travel section, how his dad’s search history was all real estate sites, how
his mom would put Benjy on her lap whenever his dad was in the room, the
violence with which his dad began to hate spoiled athletes who don’t even try,
how his mom gave three thousand dollars to the fall NPR drive, how his dad
bought a Vespa in retaliation, the end of appetizers in restaurants, the end of
the third bedtime story for Benjy, the end of eye contact.</p>

<p>He saw what they either couldn’t see or couldn’t allow
themselves to see, and that only made him more pissed, because being less stupid
than one’s parents is repulsive, like taking a gulp from a glass of milk that
you thought was orange juice. Because he was less stupid than his parents, he
knew it would one day be suggested to him that he wouldn’t have to choose, even
though he would. He knew he would begin to lose the desire or ability to fake
it in school, and his grades would roll down an inclined plane according to
some formula he was supposed to be proficient with, and the expressions of his
parents’ love would inflate in response to their sadness about his sadness, and
he would be rewarded for falling apart. His parents’ guilt about asking so much
of him would get him off the hook for organized sports, and he’d be able to
favorably renegotiate his screen time, and dinners would start to look a lot
less organic, and soon enough he’d be steering toward the iceberg while his
parents played dueling violins at each other.</p>

<p>He loved interesting facts, but was almost always troubled by
his strange recurrent thoughts. Like this one: What if he witnessed a miracle?
How would he convince anyone that he wasn’t joking? If a newborn told him a
secret? If a tree walked away? If he met his older self and learned about all
the avoidable catastrophic mistakes he would be unable to avoid? He imagined
his conversations with his mom, with his dad, with fake friends at school, with
real friends in Other Life. Most of them would just laugh. Maybe one or two
could be nudged to a gesture of belief. Max would at least want to believe him.
Benjy would believe him, but only because he believed everything. Billie? No.
Sam would be alone with a miracle.</p>

<p>There was a knock on his door. Not the sanctuary door, but his
bedroom door.</p>

<p>“Scram, fucker.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me?” his mom said, opening and entering.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” Sam said, flipping the iPad facedown on his desk. “I
thought you were Max.”</p>

<p>“And you think that’s a good way to talk to your brother?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Or to anybody?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“So why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Maybe take a moment to question yourself.”</p>

<p>He didn’t know if the suggestion was rhetorical, but he knew
this wasn’t the time to take her anything less than literally.</p>

<p>After a moment of questioning himself, the best he could muster
was “I guess I’m someone who says things he knows he shouldn’t say.”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll get better at that.”</p>

<p>She scanned the room. God, did he hate her little stolen
surveys: of his homework, his belongings, his appearance. Her constant judgment
carved through him like a river, creating two shores.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing up here?”</p>

<p>“Not e-mailing, or texting, or playing Other Life.”</p>

<p>“OK, but what have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t really know.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure how that could be possible.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this your day off?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not my day off. It’s my day to get some things done
that I’ve been putting off. Like breathing and thinking. But then we had to
make an unscheduled visit to Adas Israel this morning, as you might remember,
and then I had to meet with a client—”</p>

<p>“Why did you have to?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s my job.”</p>

<p>“But why today?”</p>

<p>“I felt that I had to, OK?”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“And then in the car it occurred to me that even though you have
almost certainly thwarted it, we should probably continue to act as if your bar
mitzvah is going to happen. And among the many, many things that only I would
remember to remember is your suit.”</p>

<p>“What suit?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“It’s true. I don’t have a suit.”</p>

<p>“Obvious once stated, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I continually find it amazing how many things are like that.”</p>

<p>“Sorry.”</p>

<p>“Why are you apologizing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“So, we need to get you a suit.”</p>

<p>“Today?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“The first three places we go aren’t going to have what we need,
and should we find something passable, it’s not going to fit, and the tailor is
going to get it wrong twice.”</p>

<p>“Do I have to be there?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“The suit place.”</p>

<p>“No, no, of course you don’t have to be there. Let’s make things
easy and build our own 3-D printer out of popsicle sticks and macaroni, and
render a perfectly accurate anatomical model of you that I can schlep to the
suit place alone on my day off.”</p>

<p>“Could we teach it my haftorah?”</p>

<p>“I’m not laughing at your jokes right now.”</p>

<p>“That didn’t require saying.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to say you aren’t laughing for someone to know
you aren’t laughing.”</p>

<p>“That didn’t require saying, either, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Sorry.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have to talk when Dad comes home from his
meeting, but I need to say something. It is required.”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>“Stop saying ‘fine.’”</p>

<p>“Sorry.”</p>

<p>“Stop saying ‘sorry.’”</p>

<p>“I thought the whole point was that I was supposed to be
apologizing?”</p>

<p>“For what you did.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t—”</p>

<p>“I’m very disappointed in you.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“That’s it? You don’t have anything else to say? Like maybe, ‘I
did it and I’m sorry’?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>She put her hands on her waist, forefingers through belt loops.</p>

<p>“Clean up this mess. It’s disgusting.”</p>

<p>“It’s my room.”</p>

<p>“But it’s our house.”</p>

<p>“I can’t move that board. We’re only halfway done with the game.
Dad said we could finish after I’m not in trouble anymore.”</p>

<p>“You know why you always beat him?”</p>

<p>“Because he lets me win.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t let you win in years.”</p>

<p>“He goes easy.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t. You beat him because it excites him to capture
pieces, but you’re always thinking four moves ahead. It makes you good at
chess, and it makes you good at life.”</p>

<p>“I’m not good at life.”</p>

<p>“You are when you’re thoughtful.”</p>

<p>“Is Dad bad at life?”</p>

<p>“That’s not the conversation we’re having right now.”</p>

<p>“If he focused, he could beat me.”</p>

<p>“That might very well be true, but we’ll never know.”</p>

<p>“What conversation are we having?”</p>

<p>She took the phone from her pocket. “What is this?”</p>

<p>“That’s a cellular telephone.”</p>

<p>“Is it yours?”</p>

<p>“I’m not allowed to have a smartphone.”</p>

<p>“Which is why it would upset me if it were yours.”</p>

<p>“So you don’t need to be upset.”</p>

<p>“Whose is it?”</p>

<p>“No idea.”</p>

<p>“Phones aren’t like dinosaur bones. They don’t just show up.”</p>

<p>“Dinosaur bones aren’t like that, either.”</p>

<p>“If I were you, I’d tone down the intelligence.” She turned the
phone over. And over. “How do I look through it?”</p>

<p>“I assume it has a password.”</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“So you’re out of luck.”</p>

<p>“I might as well try this2shallpass, right?”</p>

<p>“I guess.”</p>

<p>Every adult member of the Bloch family used that ridiculous
password for everything—from Amazon to Netflix to home alarm systems to phones.</p>

<p>“Nope,” she said, showing Sam the screen.</p>

<p>“Worth a shot.”</p>

<p>“Should I take it to the store, or something?”</p>

<p>“They don’t even open the phones of terrorists.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll try the same password, but with caps.”</p>

<p>“You could.”</p>

<p>“How do you capitalize a letter?”</p>

<p>Sam took the phone. He typed like rain hitting a skylight, but
Julia saw only the disfigured thumb, and in slow motion.</p>

<p>“Nope,” he said.</p>

<p>“Try spelling it out.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“T-o-o.”</p>

<p>“That would be pretty stupid.”</p>

<p>“It would be brilliant compared with using the same password
that’s used for everything.”</p>

<p>“T-h-i-s-t-o-o-s-h-a-l-l-p-a-s-s … Nope. Sorry. I mean, I’m not
sorry.”</p>

<p>“Try spelling it out and capitalizing the first letter.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Capital T, and t-w-o for the numeral.”</p>

<p>This he typed more slowly, carefully. “Hm.”</p>

<p>“It’s open?”</p>

<p>She reached to take the phone, but he held it for just a
fraction of a second, enough to create an awkward stutter. Sam looked at his
mother. Her enormous, ancient thumb pushed words up the tiny glass mountain.
She looked at Sam.</p>

<p>“What?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What what?”</p>

<p>“Why are you looking at me?”</p>

<p>“Why am I looking at you?”</p>

<p>“Like that?”</p>

<p>Jacob couldn’t fall asleep without a podcast. He said the
information soothed him, but Julia knew it was the company. She was usually
asleep by the time he came to bed—unacknowledged choreography—but every now and
then she’d find herself listening alone. One night, her husband snoring beside
her, she heard a sleep scientist explain lucid dreaming—a dream in which one is
aware that one is dreaming. The most common technique for bringing on a lucid
dream is to get in the habit, in waking life, of looking at texts—a page of a
book or magazine, a billboard, a screen—and then looking away, and looking
back. In dreams, texts don’t remain constant. If you exercise the habit, it
becomes a reflex. And if you exercise the reflex, it slips into dreams. The discontinuity
of the text will indicate that you’re dreaming, at which point you will not
only be aware, but also in control.</p>

<p>She looked away from the phone, and looked back.</p>

<p>“I know you don’t play Other Life. What is it you do?”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“What’s the word for what you do?”</p>

<p>“Live?” he said, trying to understand the change that was coming
over his mother’s face.</p>

<p>“I mean in Other Life.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>

<p>“You live Other Life?”</p>

<p>“I don’t usually have to describe what I’m doing there, but
sure.”</p>

<p>“You can live Other Life.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean you are allowed to.”</p>

<p>“Now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought I was grounded.”</p>

<p>“You are,” she said, putting the phone in her pocket. “But you
can live that now, if you want.”</p>

<p>“We can go get the suit.”</p>

<p>“Another day. There’s time.”</p>

<p>Sam looked away from his mother, and looked back.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>He’d checked all the devices. He wasn’t angry, he just wanted to
say what needed to be said, and then flatten the synagogue to rubble. It didn’t
fit, wasn’t home. He’d wired everything double-redundantly, and placed three
times as many explosives as were necessary: under each pew, out of sight atop
the bookshelf that held the siddurim, buried beneath the hundreds of yarmulkes
in their waist-high, octagonal wooden container.</p>

<p>Samanta removed the Torah from the ark. She chanted some
memorized nonsense, undressed the Torah, and spread it out in front of her on
the bimah. All of those beautiful pitch-black letters. All of those beautiful
minimalist sentences, combining to tell all of those beautiful, endlessly
echoing stories that should have been lost to history and still might be. The
detonator was inside the Torah pointer. Samanta grasped it, found her place on
the scroll, and started to chant.</p>

<p>&gt; Bar’chu et Adonai Ham’vorach.</p>

<p>&gt; Say what?</p>

<p>&gt; I took my little brother to the zoo and these rhinos
started fucking and it was insane. He just stood there looking. He didn’t even
know it was funny, which was the funniest part.</p>

<p>&gt; Pay attention!</p>

<p>&gt; It’s funny when someone doesn’t know it’s funny.</p>

<p>&gt; I’ve been having this weird thing where I can’t remember
what people I know look like. Or I convince myself I can’t. I’ll find myself
trying to imagine my brother’s face, and can’t. It’s not that I couldn’t pick
him out of a crowd, or that I wouldn’t recognize him. But when I try to think
of him, I can’t.</p>

see: our births, our parents’ first kiss, cavemen.</p>

<p>Samanta looked up.</p>

<p>What on earth would it take for a fundamentally good human being
to be seen? Not noticed, but seen. Not appreciated, not cherished, not even
loved. But fully seen.</p>

<p>She looked out upon the congregation of avatars. They were
trustworthy, generous, fundamentally nice unreal people. The most fundamentally
nice people she would ever meet were people she would never meet.</p>

<p>She looked simultaneously at and through the stained-glass
Jewish Present.</p>

<p>Sam had overheard every word from the other side of Rabbi
Singer’s door. He knew that his father believed him, and that his mother
didn’t. He knew that his mother was trying to do what she thought was best, and
that his father was trying to do what he thought was best. But best for whom?</p>

<p>He’d found the phone a full day before his mother had.</p>

<p>Many apologies were due, but he didn’t owe any apology to
anyone.</p>

<p>With no throat to clear, Samanta began to speak, to say what
needed to be said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>EPITOME</h2>

<p>The older one gets, the harder it is to account for time.
Children ask: “Are we there yet?” Adults: “How did we get here so quickly?”</p>

<p>Somehow, it was late. Somehow, the hours had gone somewhere. Irv
and Deborah had gone home. The boys had eaten an early dinner, taken an early
bath. Jacob and Julia had managed to collaborate in avoidance: You walk Argus,
while I help Max with his math, while you fold laundry, while I search for the
Lego piece on which everything depends, while you pretend to know how to fix a
running toilet, and somehow, the day that began as Julia’s to have to herself
ended with Jacob ostensibly out at drinks with someone-or-other from HBO and
Julia definitively cleaning up the day’s mess. So much mess made by so few
people in such little time. She was doing the dishes when Jacob entered the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“That went later than I thought,” he said preemptively. And to
further compact his guilt: “Very boring.”</p>

<p>“You must be drunk.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How do you have drinks for four hours without getting drunk?”</p>

<p>“Just a drink,” he said, draping his jacket over the counter
stool, “not drinks. And only three-and-a-half.”</p>

<p>“That’s some awfully slow sipping.” Her tone was pointed, but it
could have been sharpened by a number of things: her lost day off, the stress
from the morning, the bar mitzvah.</p>

<p>She wiped her brow with the first part of her forearm that
wasn’t soapy, and said, “We were supposed to talk to Sam.”</p>

<p>Good, Jacob thought. Of the conflicts available, this was the
least terrifying. He could apologize, make it right, get back to happiness.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said, tasting the alcohol on his teeth.</p>

<p>“You say ‘I know,’ and yet it’s night and we’re not talking to
him.”</p>

<p>“I just walked in. I was going to have a glass of water and then
go talk to him.”</p>

<p>“And the plan was to talk to him together.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can spare you from having to be bad cop.”</p>

<p>“Spare him from having a bad cop, you mean.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be both cops.”</p>

<p>“No, you’ll be a paramedic.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that means.”</p>

<p>“You’ll apologize for having to correct him in any way, and the
two of you will end up laughing, and I’ll be left as the annoying, nitpicking
mother again. You get your seven-minute wink, and I get a month of resentment.”</p>

<p>“None of what you just said is true.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>She scrubbed at the charred residue on a burnt pan.</p>

<p>“Max is asleep?” he asked, aiming his lips at hers and his eyes
to the side.</p>

<p>“It’s ten thirty.”</p>

<p>“Sam’s in his room?”</p>

<p>“One drink for four hours?”</p>

<p>“Three and a half. Someone else showed up halfway through, and
it just—”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sam is up in his emotional bomb shelter.”</p>

<p>“Playing Other Life?”</p>

<p>“Living it.”</p>

<p>They’d grown so afraid of not having the kids to fill the void.
Sometimes Julia wondered if she let them stay up only to protect herself against
the quiet, if she called Benjy onto her lap to be a human shield.</p>

<p>“How was Max’s night?”</p>

<p>“He’s depressed.”</p>

<p>“Depressed? No he’s not.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. He must just have mono.”</p>

<p>“He’s only eleven.”</p>

<p>“He’s only ten.”</p>

<p>“Depressed is a strong word.”</p>

<p>“It does a good job of describing a strong experience.”</p>

<p>“And Benjy?” Jacob asked while looking through a drawer.</p>

<p>“Missing something?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You’re searching around.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go give Benjy a kiss.”</p>

<p>“You’ll wake him up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be a ninja.”</p>

<p>“It took him an hour to fall asleep.”</p>

<p>“Literally an hour? Or it felt like an hour?”</p>

<p>“Literally sixty minutes thinking about death.”</p>

<p>“He’s an amazing kid.”</p>

<p>“Because he’s obsessed with dying?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s sensitive.”</p>

<p>Jacob looked through the mail while Julia filled the washer:
Restoration Hardware’s monthly Yellow Pages of gray furniture, the ACLU’s
weekly infringement of privacy, a never-to-be-opened financial appeal from
Georgetown Day, a flyer from some broker with orthodontics broadcasting how
much he just sold the neighbor’s house for, various paper confirmations of
paperless utilities payments, a catalog from a children’s clothing manufacturer
whose marketing algorithm wasn’t sophisticated enough to realize that
toddlerhood is a temporary state.</p>

<p>Julia held up the phone.</p>

<p>Jacob held up his body, although everything inside fell—like one
of those bottom-weighted inflatable clowns that keep coming back for more
punches.</p>

<p>“Do you know whose this is?”</p>

<p>“It’s mine,” he said, taking it. “I got a new one.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“A few weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because … people get new phones.”</p>

<p>She put too much soap in the machine and closed it too firmly.</p>

<p>“There’s a password on it.”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Your old phone didn’t have a password.”</p>

<p>“Yes it did.”</p>

<p>“No it didn’t.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because why wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Is there something you need to tell me?”</p>

<p>Jacob was busted for plagiarism in college. This was before
computer programs that could search for it, so getting caught required
flamboyant stealing, which his was. But he wasn’t caught; he accidentally confessed.
He’d been called into his “American Epic” professor’s office, asked to take a
seat, made to ferment in the halitosis while waiting for the professor to
finish reading the last three pages of a book and then clumsily shuffle through
papers on his desk in search of Jacob’s work.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bloch.”</p>

<p>Was that a statement? A confirmation that he had the right guy?</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bloch”—shaking the pages like a lulav—“where do these ideas
come from?”</p>

<p>But before the professor was given a chance to say, “Because they’re
sophisticated far beyond your years,” Jacob said, “Harold Bloom.”</p>

<p>Despite his failing grade, and despite the academic probation,
he was grateful to have made the blunder—not because honesty was so important
to him in this case, but because there was nothing he hated more than exposed
guilt. It made a terrified child out of him, and he would do anything to
relieve it.</p>

<p>“New phones ask for a password,” Jacob said. “I think they
require one.”</p>

<p>“That’s a funny way of saying no.”</p>

<p>“What was the question?”</p>

<p>“Is there something you need to tell me?”</p>

<p>“There’s always a lot of things I want to tell you.”</p>

<p>“I said need.”</p>

<p>Argus moaned.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand this conversation,” Jacob said. “And what
the hell is that smell?”</p>

<p>So many days in their shared life. So many experiences. How had
they managed to spend the previous sixteen years unlearning each other? How had
all the presence summed to disappearance?</p>

<p>And now, their first baby on the brink of manhood, and their
last asking questions about death, they found themselves in the kitchen with
things finally worth not talking about.</p>

<p>Julia noticed a small stain on her shirt and starting rubbing at
it, despite knowing it was old and permanent.</p>

<p>“I’m guessing you didn’t bring home the dry cleaning.”</p>

<p>The only thing she hated more than feeling like she was feeling
was sounding like she was sounding. As Irv had told her Golda Meir had told
Anwar Sadat: “We can forgive you for killing our children, but we will never
forgive you for making us kill yours.” She hated the person Jacob forced her to
sound like: pissy and aggrieved, unfun, the nagging wife she would have killed
herself to avoid becoming.</p>

<p>“I have a bad memory,” he said. “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“I have a bad memory, too, but I don’t forget things.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, OK?”</p>

<p>“That would be easier to accept without the OK.”</p>

<p>“You act as if I only ever make mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Help me out,” she said. “What, in this house, do you do well?”</p>

<p>“You’re serious?”</p>

<p>Argus let out a long moan.</p>

<p>Jacob turned to him and gave a bit of what he wasn’t capable of
giving to Julia: “Chill the fuck out!” And then, not appreciating the joke he
was making at his own expense: “I never raise my voice.”</p>

<p>She appreciated it: “Isn’t that right, Argus?”</p>

<p>“Not at you or the kids.”</p>

<p>“Not raising your voice—or not beating me or molesting the children,
for that matter—doesn’t qualify as something you do well. It qualifies as basic
decency. And anyway, you don’t raise your voice, because you’re repressed.”</p>

<p>“No I’m not.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t say so.”</p>

<p>“Even if that’s why I don’t raise my voice, and I don’t think it
is, it’s still a good thing. A lot of men scream.”</p>

<p>“I’m jealous of their wives.”</p>

<p>“You want me to be an asshole?”</p>

<p>“I want you to be a person.”</p>

<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>

<p>“Are you sure there isn’t something you need to tell me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand why you keep asking me that.”</p>

<p>“I’ll rephrase the question: What’s the password?”</p>

<p>“To what?”</p>

<p>“To the phone you’re clenching.”</p>

<p>“It’s my new phone. What’s the big deal?”</p>

<p>“I’m your wife. I’m the big deal.”</p>

<p>“You’re not making sense.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to.”</p>

<p>“What do you want, Julia?”</p>

<p>“Your password.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to know what it is you can’t tell me.”</p>

<p>“Julia.”</p>

<p>“Once again, you have correctly identified me.”</p>

<p>Jacob had spent more waking hours in his kitchen than in any
other room. No baby knows when the nipple is pulled from his mouth for the last
time. No child knows when he last calls his mother “Mama.” No small boy knows
when the book has closed on the last bedtime story that will ever be read to
him. No boy knows when the water drains from the last bath he will ever take
with his brother. No young man knows, as he first feels his greatest pleasure,
that he will never again not be sexual. No brinking woman knows, as she sleeps,
that it will be four decades before she will again awake infertile. No mother
knows she is hearing the word Mama for the last time. No father knows when the
book has closed on the last bedtime story he will ever read: From that day on,
and for many years to come, peace reigned on the island of Ithaca, and the gods
looked favorably upon Odysseus, his wife, and his son. Jacob knew that whatever
happened, he would see the kitchen again. And yet his eyes became sponges for
the details—the burnished handle of the snack drawer; the seam where the slabs
of soapstone met; the Special Award for Bravery sticker on the underside of the
island’s overhang, given to Max for what no one knew was his last pulled tooth,
a sticker Argus saw many times every day, and only Argus ever saw—because Jacob
knew he would one day wring them out for the last drops of these last moments;
they would come as tears.</p>

<p>“Fine,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Fine what?”</p>

<p>“Fine, I’ll tell you the password.”</p>

<p>He put the phone on the counter with a righteous force that
might, just might, have jarred loose the workings, and said, “But know that
this lack of trust will always be between us.”</p>

<p>“I can live with that.”</p>

<p>He looked at the phone.</p>

<p>“I’m just trying to remember what the password even is. I lost
it right after I got it. I don’t even think I’ve used it yet.”</p>

<p>He picked up the phone and stared at it.</p>

<p>“Maybe the password the Blochs use for everything?” she
suggested.</p>

<p>“Right,” he said. “That’s definitely what I would have used:
t-h-i-s-2-s-h-a-l-l-p-a-s-s. And … nope.”</p>

<p>“Hm. I guess not.”</p>

<p>“I can probably have the store unlock it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, and this is just a stab in the dark, you could
capitalize the first letter, and type t-w-o instead of the numeral?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do it like that,” he said.</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No. We always do it the same way.”</p>

<p>“Give it a try.”</p>

<p>He wanted to escape this childish terror, but he wanted to be a
child.</p>

<p>“But I wouldn’t do it like that.”</p>

<p>“Who really knows what one would do? Just try it.”</p>

<p>He examined the phone, and his fingers around it, and the house
around them, and with an unmediated impulse—as reflexive as the kicked leg of a
hammered knee—he hurled it through the window, shattering the glass.</p>

<p>“I thought it was open.”</p>

<p>And then a silence that struck bedrock.</p>

<p>Julia said, “You think I don’t know how to get to our lawn?”</p>

<p>“I—”</p>

<p>“And why wouldn’t you just create a sophisticated password? One
Sam wouldn’t be able to guess?”</p>

<p>“Sam looked at the phone?”</p>

<p>“No. But only because you’re incredibly lucky.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

<p>“How could you have written those things?”</p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>“It’s way too late in this conversation for that.”</p>

<p>Jacob knew it was too late, and absorbed the gouges in the
cutting board, the succulents between the sink and window, the kids’ drawings
blue-taped to the backsplash.</p>

<p>“They didn’t mean anything,” he said.</p>

<p>“I feel sorry for someone who is capable of saying so much and
meaning nothing.”</p>

<p>“Julia, give me a chance to explain.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you mean nothing to me?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You tell someone who isn’t the mother of your children that you
want to lick your cum out of her asshole, and the only person who makes me feel
beautiful is the fucking Korean florist at the back of the deli, who isn’t even
a florist.”</p>

<p>“I’m disgusting.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare do that.”</p>

<p>“Julia, this might be hard to believe, but they were only texts.
That’s all that ever happened.”</p>

<p>“First of all, that’s easy to believe. No one knows better than
I do that you’re incapable of an actually brave transgression. I know that
you’re too big a pussy to actually lick anyone’s asshole, cum-filled or not.”</p>

<p>“Julia.”</p>

<p>“But more important, how much needs to happen? You think you can
go around saying and writing whatever you want without consequence? Maybe your
father can. Maybe your mother is weak enough to tolerate that kind of
piggishness. But I’m not. There’s decency and indecency, and they’re different.
Good and bad are different. Do you not know this?”</p>

<p>“Of course I—”</p>

<p>“No, of course you don’t. You wrote to a woman who isn’t your
wife that her tight pussy doesn’t deserve you?”</p>

<p>“That’s not really what I wrote. And it was in the context of—”</p>

<p>“And you’re not really a good person, and there is no context
that could make such a thing OK to say.”</p>

<p>“It was a moment of weakness, Julia.”</p>

<p>“Are you forgetting that you never deleted any of them? That
there is a history to refer to? It wasn’t a moment of weakness, it was a person
of weakness. And will you please stop saying my name.”</p>

<p>“It’s over.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to know the worst part? I don’t even care. The
saddest thing about this has been confronting my own lack of sadness.”</p>

<p>Jacob didn’t believe that, but neither could he believe that she
would say it. The pretense of a loving relationship had made the absence of a
loving relationship bearable. But now she was letting go of appearances.</p>

<p>“Listen, I think—”</p>

<p>“Lick the cum out of her asshole?” She laughed. “You? You’re a
coward and a germ freak. You just wanted to write it. Which is fine. Which is
even great. But acknowledge the make-believe. You want to want some kind of
sexually supercharged life, but you actually want the gate-checked stroller,
and the Aquaphor, and even your desiccated, blowjobless existence, because it
spares you worrying about erections. Jesus, Jacob, you carry a packet of wipes
so you’ll never have to use toilet paper. That’s not the behavior of a man who
wants to lick cum from anyone’s asshole.”</p>

<p>“Julia, stop.”</p>

<p>“And by the way, even if you found yourself in that situation,
with an actual woman’s actual asshole filled with your actual cum and beckoning
your tongue? You know what you’d do? You’d get your ridiculous hand tremors,
sweat through your shirt, lose the one-quarter, Jell-O mold erection you would
have been lucky to achieve in the first place, and probably shuffle off to the
bathroom to check the Huffington Post for puerile, unfunny videos or relisten
to the Radiolab in praise of tortoises. That’s what would happen. And she’d
know you were the joke that you are.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be wearing a shirt.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t sweat through my shirt, because I wouldn’t be
wearing a shirt.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fucking mean thing to say.”</p>

<p>“Stop pushing me.”</p>

<p>“You’re serious? You can’t be. You cannot be serious.” She
turned on the sink faucet, for no obvious reason. “And you think you’re the
only one who wants to act recklessly?”</p>

<p>“You want to have an affair?”</p>

<p>“I want to let things fall apart.”</p>

<p>“I’m not having an affair, and I’m not letting things fall
apart.”</p>

<p>“I saw Mark today. He and Jennifer are getting divorced.”</p>

<p>“Great. Or terrible. What am I supposed to say?”</p>

<p>“And Mark was flirting with me.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I’ve protected you so much. Cared for your pathetic, baby-bird
insecurity. Spared you innocent things that you would have had no right to be
upset by, but would be crushed by. And you think I’ve never had fantasies? You
think every time I masturbate I’m imagining you? Do you?”</p>

<p>“This isn’t going anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Did some part of me want to fuck Mark today? Yes. In fact,
every part below the brain. But I didn’t, because I wouldn’t, because I’m not
like you—”</p>

<p>“I didn’t fuck anybody, Julia.”</p>

<p>“—but I wanted to.”</p>

<p>Jacob raised his voice for the second time in the conversation:
“Goddamn it, what’s that smell?”</p>

<p>“Your dog took another shit in the house.”</p>

<p>“My dog?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the dog that you brought home, despite our explicit
agreement not to get a dog.”</p>

<p>“The kids wanted it.”</p>

<p>“The kids want their arms connected to IV drip bags filled with
melted Chunky Monkey and their brains in vats of Steve Jobs’s cum. Good
parenting has nothing to do with satisfying your children’s wants.”</p>

<p>“They were sad about something.”</p>

<p>“Everybody is sad about something. Stop blaming the kids, Jacob.
You needed to be a hero, and you needed to make me a villain—”</p>

<p>“That’s not fair.”</p>

<p>“Not even close to fair. You brought home a dog that we agreed
it would be a mistake to get, and you were the superhero and I was the
supervillain, and now there’s a stale shit-bâtard on our living room floor.”</p>

<p>“And it didn’t occur to you to clean it up?”</p>

<p>“No. Just like it didn’t occur to you to house-train it—”</p>

<p>“Him. House-train him. And the poor guy can’t help it. He’s—”</p>

<p>“Or walk it, or take it to the vet, or wash its bed, or remember
its heartworm pills, or check it for ticks, or buy it food, or feed it. I pick
up his shit every single day. Twice a day. Or more. Jesus, Jacob, I hate dogs,
and hate this dog, and didn’t and don’t want this dog, but if it weren’t for
me, this dog would have been dead years ago.”</p>

<p>“He understands you when you say that.”</p>

<p>“And yet you don’t. Your dog—”</p>

<p>“Our dog.”</p>

<p>“—is smarter than my husband.”</p>

<p>And then he screamed. It was the first time he’d ever raised his
voice at her. It was a scream that had been building in him for sixteen years
of marriage, and four decades of life, and five millennia of history—a scream
that was directed at her, but also at everyone living and dead, but primarily
at himself. For years he’d always been elsewhere, always underground behind a
twelve-inch door, always taking refuge in an interior monologue to which no
one—including himself—had access, or in dialogue trapped in a locked drawer.
But this was him.</p>

<p>He took four steps toward her, bringing the lenses of his
glasses as close to her eyes as to his own, and screamed: “You are my enemy!”</p>

<p>A few minutes before, she’d told Jacob that the saddest thing
had been confronting her own lack of sadness. It was true then, but it wasn’t
true anymore. Through the prism of tears, she saw her kitchen: the cracked
rubber gasket of the faucet, the casement windows that still looked good but
whose frames would crumble if gripped. She saw her dining room and living room:
they still looked good, but were two layers of paint over a layer of primer
over a decade and a half of slow decay. Her husband: not her partner.</p>

<p>Sam came home from third grade one day and excitedly told Julia,
“If Earth were the size of an apple, the atmosphere would be thinner than the
apple’s skin.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“If Earth were the size of an apple, the atmosphere would be
thinner than the apple’s skin.”</p>

<p>“I might not be smart enough to understand why that’s
interesting. Can you explain?”</p>

<p>“Look up,” he said. “Does it seem thin to you?”</p>

<p>“The ceiling?”</p>

<p>“If we were outside.”</p>

<p>The shell was so thin, but she had always felt safe.</p>

<p>They got a dartboard at a yard sale, dozens of Sundays before,
and hung it on the door at the end of the hall. The boys missed the board as
often as they hit it, and each dart pulled from the door held the door’s
previous color on its tip. Julia took the board down after Max came into the
living room, blood dripping from his shoulder, saying, “It was nobody’s fault.”
What remained was a circle, defined and surrounded by hundreds of holes.</p>

<p>As she stared at the shell of her kitchen, the saddest thing was
her knowledge of what was beneath, what a tiny scratch, in a vulnerable place,
would reveal.</p>

<p>“Mom?”</p>

<p>They turned to see Benjy standing in the doorway, leaning
against the growth chart, his hands searching for pajama pockets that didn’t
exist. For how long had he been there?</p>

<p>“Mom and I were just—”</p>

<p>“You mean epitome.”</p>

<p>“What, love?”</p>

<p>“You said enemy, but you meant epitome.”</p>

<p>“You can have your kiss now,” Julia told Jacob as she wiped away
her tears, replacing them with soap suds.</p>

<p>Jacob got down on his knees, took Benjy’s hands into his.</p>

<p>“Bad dream, buddy?”</p>

<p>“I’m OK with dying,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’m OK with dying.”</p>

<p>“You are?”</p>

<p>“As long as everyone else dies with me, I’m actually OK with
dying. I’m just afraid of everyone else not dying.”</p>

<p>“You had a bad dream?”</p>

<p>“No. You were fighting.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t fighting. We—”</p>

<p>“And I heard glass break.”</p>

<p>“We were fighting,” Julia said. “Humans have feelings, sometimes
very difficult ones. But it’s OK. Now go on back to bed.”</p>

<p>Jacob carried him, Benjy’s cheek resting on his shoulder. How
light he still was. How heavy he was getting. No father knows that he is
carrying his son up the stairs for the final time.</p>

<p>Jacob tucked Benjy back under the covers and stroked his hair.</p>

<p>“Dad?”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I agree with you that heaven probably doesn’t exist.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that. I said there’s no way to know for sure, and
so it’s probably not a great idea to organize our lives around it.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s what I agree with.”</p>

<p>He could forgive himself for withholding his own comfort, but
why did he withhold everyone else’s as well? Why couldn’t he just let his
kindergartener feel happy and safe in a just and beautiful and unreal world?</p>

<p>“So what do you think we should organize our lives around?”
Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“Our families?”</p>

<p>“I think so, too.”</p>

<p>“Good night, buddy.”</p>

<p>Jacob went to the door, but didn’t walk away.</p>

<p>After a few long moments in that silence, Benjy called out:
“Dad? I need you!”</p>

<p>“I’m here.”</p>

<p>“Squirrels evolved to have bushy tails. Why?”</p>

<p>“Maybe for balance? Or to keep them warm? Time for sleep.”</p>

<p>“We’ll google it in the morning.”</p>

<p>“OK. But now sleep.”</p>

<p>“Dad?”</p>

<p>“Right here.”</p>

<p>“If the world goes on for long enough, will there be fossils of
fossils?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Benjy. That’s a great question. We can talk about it in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I need my sleep.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“Dad?”</p>

<p>Now Jacob was losing his patience: “Benjy.”</p>

<p>“Dad?”</p>

<p>“I’m here.”</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway until he heard his youngest son’s heavy
breathing. Jacob was a man who withheld comfort but stood at thresholds long
after others would have walked away. He always stood at the open front door
until the car pool drove off. Just as he stood at the window until the back
wheel of Sam’s bike disappeared around the corner. Just as he watched himself
disappear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>HERE I AMN’T</h2>

<p>&gt; It is with a sense of history and extreme annoyance that I
stand at this bimah today, prepared to fulfill the so-called rite of passage
into adulthood, whatever that is. I want to thank Cantor Fleischman, for
helping transform me, over the past half year, into a Jewish automaton. On the
extreme off chance that I remember any of this a year from now, I still won’t
know what it means, and for that I am grateful. I also want to thank Rabbi
Singer, who is a sulfuric acid enema. My only living great-grandparent is Isaac
Bloch. My dad said that I had to go through with this for him, something my
great-grandfather has never, himself, asked of me. There are things he has
asked, like not to be forced to move into the Jewish Home. My family cares very
much about caring for him, but not enough to actually care, and I didn’t understand
a word of my chanting today, but I understand that. I want to thank my
grandparents Irv and Deborah Bloch, for being inspirations in my life and
always urging me to try a little bit harder, dig a little bit deeper, become
rich, and say whatever I want whenever I feel like it. Also my grandparents
Allen and Leah Selman, who live in Florida, and whose mortal status I am only
aware of thanks to the Hanukkah and birthday checks that haven’t been adjusted
for cost-of-living increases since my birth. I want to thank my brothers, Benjy
and Max, for requiring great portions of my parents’ attention. I cannot
imagine surviving an existence in which I bore the undivided brunt of their
love. Also, when I threw up on Benjy on a plane, he said, “I know how bad it feels
to throw up.” And Max once offered to get a blood test so I wouldn’t have to.
Which brings me to my parents, Jacob and Julia Bloch. The truth is, I didn’t
want to have a bat mitzvah. No part of me, not even a little. There aren’t
enough savings bonds in the world. We had conversations about it, as if my
opinions were of consequence. It was all a charade, a charade to set in motion
this charade, itself only a stepping-stone in the charade of my Jewish
identity. Which is to say, in the most literal sense, without them this
wouldn’t have been possible. I don’t blame them for being who they are. But I
do blame them for blaming me for being who I am. That’s enough thanking. So, my
Torah portion is Vayeira. It is one of the most well-known and studied portions
in the Torah, and I’ve been told it is a great honor to read it. Given my total
lack of interest in the Torah, it would have been better to give this to a kid
who actually gives a Jewish shit, should such a kid exist, and to give me one
of the throwaway portions about rules governing menstruating lepers. Joke’s on
everyone, I guess. One more thing: portions of the interpretation that follows
were blatantly ripped off. Good thing Jews only believe in collective
punishment. OK . . God’s test of Abraham is written like this: “Sometime later,
God tested Abraham. He said to him, ‘Abraham!’ ‘Here I am,’ Abraham replied.”
Most people assume that the test is what follows: God asking Abraham to
sacrifice his son, Isaac. But I think it could also be read that the test was
when He called to him. Abraham didn’t say, “What do you want?” He didn’t say,
“Yes?” He answered with a statement: “Here I am.” Whatever God needs or wants,
Abraham is wholly present for Him, without conditions or reservations or need
for explanation. That word, hineni—here I am—comes up two other times in the
portion. When Abraham is taking Isaac up Mount Moriah, Isaac becomes aware of
what they are doing, and how fucked up it is. He knows that he is about to be
the sacrifice, in the way that all kids always do when it’s about to happen. It
says: “And Isaac said to Abraham, his father, ‘My father!’ and he said, ‘Here I
am, my son.’ And Isaac said, ‘Here is the fire and the wood but where is the
sheep for the offering?’ And Abraham said, ‘God will see to the sheep for the
offering, my son.’” Isaac doesn’t say, “Father,” he says, “My father.” Abraham
is the father of the Jewish people, but he is also Isaac’s father, his personal
father. And Abraham doesn’t ask, “What do you want?” He says, “Here I am.” When
God asks for Abraham, Abraham is wholly present for God. When Isaac asks for
Abraham, Abraham is wholly present for his son. But how can that be possible?
God is asking Abraham to kill Isaac, and Isaac is asking his father to protect
him. How can Abraham be two directly opposing things at once? Hineni is used
one more time in the story, at the most dramatic moment. “And they came to the
place that God had said to him, and Abraham built there an altar and laid out
the wood and bound Isaac, his son, and placed him on the altar on top of the
wood. And Abraham reached out his hand and took the cleaver to his son. And the
Lord’s messenger called out to him from the heavens, and said, ‘Abraham,
Abraham!’ and he said, ‘Here I am.’ And he said, ‘Do not reach out your hand
against the boy, and do nothing to him, for now I know that you fear God and
you have not held back your son, your only one, from me.’” Abraham does not
ask, “What do you want?” He says, “Here I am.” My bat mitzvah portion is about
many things, but I think it is primarily about who we are wholly there for, and
how that, more than anything else, defines our identity. My great-grandfather,
who I mentioned before, has asked for help. He doesn’t want to go to the Jewish
Home. But nobody in the family has responded by saying, “Here I am.” Instead,
they have tried to convince him that he doesn’t know what is best, and doesn’t
even know what he wants. Really, they haven’t even tried to convince him;
they’ve just told him what he’s going to do. I was accused of having used some
bad language in Hebrew school this morning. I’m not even sure used is the right
word—making a list is hardly making use of anything. Anyway, when my parents
showed up to speak with Rabbi Singer, they didn’t tell me, “Here we are.” They
asked, “What did you do?” I wish I had been given the benefit of the doubt,
because I deserve it. Everyone who knows me knows that I make a shitload of
mistakes, but also that I am a good person. But it’s not because I’m a good
person that I deserve the benefit of the doubt, it’s because I’m their child.
Even if they didn’t believe me, they should have acted as if they did. My dad
once told me that before I was born, when the only proof of my life was
sonograms, he had to believe in me. In other words, being born allows your
parents to stop believing in you. OK, thanks for coming, everybody out.</p>

<p>&gt; That’s it?</p>

<p>&gt; No. Not exactly. I’m going to blow this place up.</p>

<p>&gt; What the fuck?</p>

<p>&gt; I set up a reception on the roof of the old color film
factory across the street. We’ll watch.</p>

<p>&gt; Run!</p>

<p>&gt; Color film?</p>

<p>&gt; You don’t need to run. No one is going to get hurt.</p>

<p>&gt; Trust her.</p>

<p>&gt; Film for old-fashioned cameras.</p>

<p>&gt; You don’t even need to trust me. Think about it: if you’d
needed to run, you’d already be dead.</p>

<p>&gt; That’s some fucked-up logic.</p>

<p>&gt; Last thing, before we go: Does anybody know why airplanes
dim their lights at takeoff and landing?</p>

<p>&gt; What the fuck?</p>

<p>&gt; So the pilot can see better?</p>

<p>&gt; Let’s just go, OK?</p>

<p>&gt; To save power?</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t want to die.</p>

<p>&gt; Good guesses, but no. It’s because those are the most
critical moments of the flight. More than eighty percent of accidents happen
during takeoff and landing. They dim the lights to give your eyes time to
adjust to the darkness of a smoke-filled cabin.</p>

<p>&gt; There should be a word for things like that.</p>

<p>&gt; You can follow the lighted path out of the synagogue. It
will show you the way. Or you can follow me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>SOMEONE! SOMEONE!</h2>

<p>Julia was at her bathroom sink, Jacob at his. Side-by-side
sinks: a much-sought-after feature in old Cleveland Park houses, like intricate
borders framing the parquet floors, original mantels, and converted gas
chandeliers. There were so few differences between the houses that the small
differences had to be celebrated, otherwise everyone was working too hard for
too little. On the other hand, who actually wants side-by-side sinks?</p>

<p>“You know what Benjy just asked me?” Jacob said, facing the
mirror above his sink.</p>

<p>“If the world goes on for long enough, will there be fossils of
fossils?”</p>

<p>“How did you—?”</p>

<p>“The monitor knows all.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>Jacob almost always flossed when there was a witness. Forty
years of sometimes flossing, and he’d had only three cavities—all that saved
time. Tonight, his wife his witness, he flossed. He wanted to spend a little
time at those side-by-side sinks. Or spare a little time in that one bed.</p>

<p>“When I was a kid, I created my own postal system. I made a post
office out of a refrigerator box. My mom sewed a uniform for me. I even had
stamps with my grandfather’s face on them.”</p>

<p>“Why are you telling me this?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said, a thread between his two front teeth.
“I just thought of it.”</p>

<p>“Why did you just think of it?”</p>

<p>He chuckled: “You sound like Dr. Silvers.”</p>

<p>She didn’t chuckle: “You love Dr. Silvers.”</p>

<p>“I had nothing to deliver,” he said, “so I started writing
letters to my mom. It was the system I was drawn to; I didn’t care about the
messages. Anyway, the first one said, ‘If you’re reading this, our postal
system works!’ I remember that.”</p>

<p>“Our,” she said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Our. Our postal system. Not my postal system.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I wrote my,” he said, unwinding the thread from his
fingers, revealing the impressions of rings. “I can’t remember.”</p>

<p>“You can.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You can. And that’s why you’re telling it to me.”</p>

<p>“She was a great mom,” he said.</p>

<p>“I know that. I’ve always known that. She manages to make the
boys feel that no one in the world is better than them, and that they aren’t
better than anyone. That’s a hard balance.”</p>

<p>“My dad doesn’t strike it.”</p>

<p>“There is no balance that he strikes.”</p>

<p>The impressions were already gone.</p>

<p>Julia picked up a toothbrush and handed it to her husband.</p>

<p>Jacob tried to force something that wouldn’t come, and said,
“We’re out of toothpaste.”</p>

<p>“There’s another in the cabinet.”</p>

<p>A moment of quiet while they brushed. If they spent ten minutes
every night getting ready for bed—and surely they did, surely at least that
much—it would be sixty hours a year. More hours getting ready for bed together
than being awake on vacation together. They had been married for sixteen years.
In that time, they had spent the equivalent of forty full days getting ready
for bed, almost always at the sought-after and lonely side-by-side sinks,
almost always quietly.</p>

<p>A few months after moving out, Jacob would create a postal
system with the boys. Max was receding. He laughed less, scowled more, always
sought the seat closest to the window. Jacob could deny it to himself, but then
others started to notice and mention it—Deborah took him aside one brunch and
asked, “How does Max seem to you?”</p>

<p>Jacob found vintage hanging mailboxes on Etsy and affixed one to
each kid’s bedroom door, and one to his own. He told them they would have their
own secret postal system, to be used for those messages that felt impossible to
say aloud.</p>

<p>“Like how people used to leave notes in the Wailing Wall,” Benjy
suggested.</p>

<p>No, Jacob thought, but he said, “Yes. Kind of like that.”</p>

<p>“Except you’re not God,” Max said, which, although plainly
obvious, and the position Jacob would want his children to take (as atheists,
and people who don’t fear their parents), still stung.</p>

<p>He checked his mailbox every day. Benjy was the only one who
ever wrote: “World peace”; “Snow day”; “Bigger TV.”</p>

<p>So much about parenting alone was difficult: the logistics of
getting three kids ready for school with only two hands, the Heathrow
control-tower volume of transportation to coordinate, having to multitask the
multitasking. But most challenging was finding time to talk intimately with the
kids. They were always together, there was always commotion, something always
needed to get done, and there was no one with whom to share the load. So when
one-on-one situations arose, he felt both a need to make use of them (however
unnatural it might be at the time) and a concentrated dose of the old fear of
saying too much or too little.</p>

<p>One night a few weeks after the creation of the postal system,
Sam was reading to Benjy before bed, and Max and Jacob found themselves peeing
into the same toilet.</p>

<p>“Don’t cross the streams, Ray.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“From Ghostbusters.”</p>

<p>“I know that’s a movie, but I’ve never seen it.”</p>

<p>“You’re kidding.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But I remember watching with—”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen it.”</p>

<p>“OK. Well, there’s a great scene in which they fire their
proton-whatevers for the first time, and Egon says, ‘Don’t cross the streams,
Ray,’ because it would result in some sort of apocalyptic moment, and ever
since, I’ve always thought about it when peeing in the same toilet with
someone. But we both seem to be finished, so now it really makes no sense.”</p>

<p>“Whatever.”</p>

<p>“I noticed you haven’t put anything in my mailbox.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I will.”</p>

<p>“It’s not an assignment. I just thought it might be a helpful
way to get some things off your chest.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“Everyone holds things in. Your brothers do. I do. Mom does. But
it can make life really difficult.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“No, I meant for you. I’ve spent my life making huge efforts to
protect myself from the things I most fear, and in the end it wouldn’t be right
to say that there was nothing to fear, but maybe the realization of my worst
fears wouldn’t have been so bad. Maybe all of my efforts were worse. I remember
the night I left for the airport. I kissed you guys like it was any other trip,
and said something like ‘See you in a week or two.’ As I was getting ready to
go, Mom asked me what I was waiting for. She said it was a big deal so I must
be feeling big things, and you guys must be, too.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t come back and say anything else.”</p>

<p>“I was too afraid.”</p>

<p>“What were you afraid of?”</p>

<p>“There was nothing to be afraid of. That’s what I’m trying to
tell you.”</p>

<p>“I know there was nothing actually to be afraid of. But what
were you afraid of?”</p>

<p>“Making it real?”</p>

<p>“Going?”</p>

<p>“No. What we had. What we have.”</p>

<p>Julia tucked her toothbrush deep in her cheek and brought her
palms to the sink. Jacob spit, and said, “I’m failing my family just like my
father failed us.”</p>

<p>“You’re not,” she said. “But it’s not enough to avoid his
mistakes.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>She removed the brush and said, “You’re not. But it’s not enough
to avoid his mistakes.”</p>

<p>“You’re a great mom.”</p>

<p>“What made you say that?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking about how my mom was a great mom.”</p>

<p>She closed the vanity, paused, as if considering whether to
speak, then spoke: “You aren’t happy.”</p>

<p>“What made you say that?”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth. You seem happy. Maybe you even think you’re
happy. But you aren’t.”</p>

<p>“You think I’m depressed?”</p>

<p>“No. I think you put enormous emphasis on happiness—your own and
others’—and find unhappiness so threatening that you would rather go down with
the ship than acknowledge a leak.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s true.”</p>

<p>“And yes, I think you’re depressed.”</p>

<p>“It’s probably just mono.”</p>

<p>“You’re tired of writing a TV show that isn’t yours, and that
everyone loves but you.”</p>

<p>“Not everyone loves it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you definitely don’t.”</p>

<p>“I like it.”</p>

<p>“And you hate only liking what you do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“But you do know,” she said. “You know there’s something inside
of you—a book, or show, or movie, whatever—and if it could only be released,
all of the sacrifices you feel you’ve made wouldn’t feel like sacrifices
anymore.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel that I’ve had to make—”</p>

<p>“See how you changed the grammar? I said, the sacrifices you
feel you’ve made. You said, had to make. See the difference?”</p>

<p>“Jesus, you should really get some accreditation and a couch.”</p>

<p>“I’m not kidding.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“And you’re tired of pretending to be happily married—”</p>

<p>“Julia.”</p>

<p>“—and you hate only liking the most important relationship in
your life.”</p>

<p>Jacob often resented Julia, sometimes even hated her, but there
was never a moment when he wanted to hurt her.</p>

<p>“That isn’t true,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’re too kind or scared to admit it, but it’s true.”</p>

<p>“It’s not.”</p>

<p>“And you’re tired of being a dad and a son.”</p>

<p>“Why are you trying to hurt me?”</p>

<p>“I’m not trying to. And there are worse things than hurting each
other.” She arranged the various anti-aging and anti-dying products on the
shelf and said, “Let’s go to bed.”</p>

<p>Let’s go to bed. Those four words differentiate a marriage from
every other kind of relationship. We aren’t going to find a way to agree, but
let’s go to bed. Not because we want to, but because we have to. We hate each
other right now, but let’s go to bed. It’s the only bed we have. Let’s go to
our sides, but the sides of the same bed. Let’s retreat into ourselves, but
together. How many conversations had ended with those four words? How many
fights?</p>

<p>Sometimes they would go to bed and make one more effort, now
horizontal, to work it through. Sometimes going to bed made things possible
that weren’t possible in the infinitely large room. The intimacy of being under
the same sheet, two furnaces contributing to the shared warmth, but at the same
time not having to see each other. The view of the ceiling, and all that
ceilings make one think about. Or perhaps it was at the back of the brain,
where all the blood then pooled, that the generosity lobe was located.</p>

<p>Sometimes they would go to bed and roll to the edges of the
mattress that they independently wished were a king, and independently wish it
would all just go away, without having enough bones in their forefingers to
hold down the word it. It the night? It the marriage? It the entire predicament
of this family’s family life? They went to bed together not because they didn’t
have a choice—kein briere iz oich a breire, as the rabbi would say at the
funeral in three weeks; not to have a choice is also a choice. Marriage is the
opposite of suicide, but is its only peer as a definitive act of will.</p>

<p>Let’s go to bed …</p>

<p>Just before easing himself onto the bed, Jacob gave a puzzled
look, patted his boxer briefs’ nonexistent pockets, as if suddenly realizing he
didn’t know where his key was, and said, “I’m just going to pee.” Exactly as he
did every night at that moment.</p>

<p>He closed and locked the door, opened the middle drawer of the
medicine cabinet, lifted the stack of New Yorkers, and removed the box of
hydrocortisone acetate suppositories. He laid out a bath towel on the floor,
rolled another into a pillow, rested himself on his left side with his right
knee bent, thought about Terri Schiavo, or Bill Buckner, or Nicole Brown
Simpson, and gently pushed it in. He suspected that Julia knew what he did
every night, but he couldn’t bring himself to ask her, because that would first
require admitting to having an entire human body. Almost all of his body was
sharable almost all of the time, as was almost all of hers almost always, but
sometimes some parts had to be hidden. They had spent countless hours parsing
the bowel movements of their children; directly applied Desitin with bare
forefingers; twirled rectal thermometers, at Dr. Donowitz’s instruction, to
stimulate the sphincter in an effort to relieve a baby’s constipation. But when
it came to each other, some denial was required.</p>

<p>you don’t deserve to get fucked in the ass</p>

<p>The asshole, with which every member of the Bloch family was, in
his or her own way, obsessed, was the epicenter of Jacob and Julia’s denial. It
was necessary for life, but never to be spoken of. It was what one had, but had
to hide. It was where everything came together—the cinch of the human body—and
nothing, especially not attention, and especially not a finger or cock, and
especially, especially not a tongue, could go. There were enough matches by the
toilet to both light and fuel a bonfire.</p>

<p>Every night, Jacob excused himself to pee, and every night Julia
waited for him, and she knew he hid the suppository wrappers in balls of toilet
paper at the bottom of the lidded can, and she knew that when he flushed he
flushed nothing. Those minutes of hiding, of silent shame, had walls and a
ceiling. Just as their Shabbats, and those whispered confessions of pride, had
made architecture of time. Without having hired any men with lumbar braces, or
sent change-of-address cards, or even replaced one key on their heart’s ring
with another, they had moved from one house to another.</p>

<p>Max used to love playing hide-and-seek, and no one, not even
Benjy, could tolerate it. The house was too well known, too thoroughly
explored, the game was as done as checkers. So it was only on special occasions
(a birthday, as a reward for an act of extreme menschiness) that Max was able to
force a game. And they were always as boring as everyone anticipated: someone
was holding his breath behind Julia’s blouses in the closet, someone was flat
in the bath or crouched under the sink, someone was hiding with his eyes
closed, unable to overcome the instinct that it made him less visible.</p>

<p>Even when the boys weren’t hiding, Jacob and Julia were seeking
them—out of fear, out of love. But hours could pass without Argus’s absence
being noticed. He’d always turn up when the front door was opened, or the bath
was run, or food was put on the table. His return was taken for granted. Jacob
tried to stimulate heated discussion at dinner, to help the boys become
eloquent, critical thinkers. In the middle of one such debate—should Jerusalem
or Tel Aviv be Israel’s capital?—Julia asked if anyone had seen Argus. “His
dinner is just sitting there.”</p>

<p>After only a few minutes of gentle calling for him and casual
searching, the boys began to panic. They rang the doorbell. They put out a bowl
of human food. Max played through Suzuki Book I, which always elicited a whine.
Nothing.</p>

<p>The screen door was closed, but the front door was open, so it
was conceivable he had gone outside. (Who left the door open? Jacob
wondered—angry, but at no one.) They searched the neighborhood, calling for
Argus, lovingly then desperately. Some neighbors joined the search. Jacob
couldn’t help but wonder—only to himself, of course—if Argus had gone off to
die, as some dogs apparently do. It became dark, hard to see.</p>

<p>As it turned out, he’d been in the upstairs guest bathroom.
Somehow he’d closed himself in, and was too old, or good, to bark. Or maybe, at
least until he became hungry, he preferred it in there. He was allowed to sleep
in the bed that night. As were the kids. Because they’d thought they’d lost
him, and because he’d been so close all along.</p>

<p>At dinner the next night, Jacob said: “Resolved: Argus should be
allowed to sleep in the bed every night.” The boys whooped. Smiling, Jacob
said, “I take it you’ll be arguing the affirmative.”</p>

<p>Not smiling, Julia said, “Wait, wait, wait.”</p>

<p>It was the last time those six animals slept under the same
cover.</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia hid themselves inside the work that they hid
from each other.</p>

<p>They sought happiness that didn’t have to be at the expense of
anyone else’s happiness.</p>

<p>They hid behind the administration of family life.</p>

<p>Their purest seeking was on Shabbat, when they closed their eyes
and made their home, and themselves, new.</p>

<p>That architecture of minutes, when Jacob excused himself to the
bathroom and Julia didn’t read the book she held, was their purest hiding.</p>

<p>now you deserve to get fucked in the ass</p>

<p>They went to bed, Julia in her nightgown, Jacob in his T-shirt
and boxers. She slept with a bra on. She said the support made her more
comfortable, and maybe that was the entire truth. He said the warmth of the
shirt made it easier to sleep, and maybe that was entirely true as well. They
turned off the lights, took off their glasses, and stared through the same
ceiling, the same roof, with two pairs of flawed eyes that could be compensated
for but were never going to get better on their own.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d known me when I was a kid,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“A kid?”</p>

<p>“Or just … before. Before I became this.”</p>

<p>“You wish I’d known you before you knew me.”</p>

<p>“No. You don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Find another way to say it.”</p>

<p>“Julia, I am not … myself.”</p>

<p>“Then who are you?”</p>

<p>Jacob wanted to cry, but couldn’t. But he also couldn’t hide his
hiding. She stroked his hair. There was nothing that she forgave him for.
Nothing. Not the texts, not the years. But she couldn’t not respond to his
need. She didn’t want to, but she couldn’t not. It was a version of love. But
double negatives never sustained a religion.</p>

<p>He said, “I’ve never said what I feel.”</p>

<p>“Never?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s quite an indictment.”</p>

<p>“It’s true.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, with her first chuckle since finding the
phone, “there are so many other things you do well.”</p>

<p>“That’s the sound of all not being lost.”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“Your chuckle.”</p>

<p>“That? No, that was the sound of appreciated irony.”</p>

<p>Fall asleep, he implored himself. Fall asleep.</p>

<p>“What do I do well?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You’re serious?”</p>

<p>“Just one thing.”</p>

<p>He was hurting. And no matter how much she felt he deserved the
hurt, she couldn’t tolerate it. She’d devoted so much of herself—forfeited so
much of herself—to protecting him. How many experiences, how many subjects of
conversation, how many words, were sacrificed in order to soothe his profound
vulnerability? They couldn’t go to a city that she’d been to with a boyfriend
twenty years before. She couldn’t make gentle observations about the lack of
boundaries at his parents’ house, much less his own parenting choices, which
often resembled the absence of choices. She picked up Argus’s shits because
Argus couldn’t help it, and because, even if she didn’t choose or want him, and
even if it was an unfair burden, Argus was hers.</p>

<p>“You’re kind,” she told her husband.</p>

<p>“No. I’m really not.”</p>

<p>“I could give you a hundred examples…”</p>

<p>“Three or four would be extremely helpful right now.”</p>

<p>She didn’t want to do this, but she couldn’t not. “You always
return your grocery cart to the right place. You fold up your Post and leave it
for another reader on the Metro. You draw maps for lost tourists…”</p>

<p>“Is that kindness, or conscientiousness?”</p>

<p>“So you’re conscientious.”</p>

<p>Could he tolerate her hurt? She wanted to know, but didn’t trust
him to tell her.</p>

<p>She asked, “Does it make you sad that we love the kids more than
we love each other?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t put it that way.”</p>

<p>“No, you would say I’m your enemy.”</p>

<p>“I was worked up.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t meaning what I was saying.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she said. “But you were saying it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that anger reveals truth. Sometimes you just
say something.”</p>

<p>“I know. But I don’t believe that any something comes from
nowhere.”</p>

<p>“I don’t love the kids more than I love you.”</p>

<p>“You do,” she said. “I do. Maybe we’re supposed to. Maybe
evolution forces us to.”</p>

<p>“I love you,” he said, turning to her.</p>

<p>“I know you do. I’ve never doubted that, and I don’t doubt it
now. But it’s a different kind of love than the kind I need.”</p>

<p>“What does that mean for us?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Fall asleep, Jacob.</p>

<p>He said, “You know how novocaine leaves you unsure of where your
mouth ends and the world begins?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I do.”</p>

<p>“Or how sometimes you think there’s going to be another stair
when there isn’t, and your foot falls through an imaginary stair?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>Why was it so hard for him to cross the physical space? It
shouldn’t have been, but it was.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I was saying.”</p>

<p>She could feel him struggling.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>He tucked his hand behind her hair, cupping the back of her
neck.</p>

<p>“You’re tired,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m really exhausted.”</p>

<p>“We’re tired. We’ve run ourselves into the ground. We need to
find ways to rest.”</p>

<p>“I would understand if you were having an affair. I’d be angry,
and I’d be hurt, and I’d probably be moved to do something I don’t even want to
do—”</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>“I would hate you, Jacob, but at least I’d understand you. I
always understood you. Remember how I would tell you that? That you were the
only person who made sense to me? Now everything you do confuses me.”</p>

<p>“Confuses you?”</p>

<p>“Your obsession with real estate.”</p>

<p>“I’m not obsessed with real estate.”</p>

<p>“Every time I walk past your laptop, the screen is filled with a
house listing.”</p>

<p>“Just curious.”</p>

<p>“But why? And why won’t you tell Sam he’s better than you at
chess?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“You don’t. You let him believe that you let him win. And why
are you such a completely different person in different situations? You become
passive-aggressively quiet with me, but you snap at the boys, but you let your
father walk all over you. You haven’t written me a Friday letter in a decade,
but you spend all of your free time working on something that you love but
won’t share with anyone, and then you write those texts that you say mean
nothing. I walked seven circles around you when we got married. I can’t even
find you now.”</p>

<p>“I’m not having an affair.”</p>

<p>“You’re not?”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>She started to cry.</p>

<p>“I exchanged some horribly inappropriate texts with someone at
work.”</p>

<p>“An actress.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Does it matter?”</p>

<p>“If it matters to me, it matters.”</p>

<p>“One of the directors.”</p>

<p>“Who has my name?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Is it that woman with the red hair?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You know, I don’t even care.”</p>

<p>“Good. You shouldn’t. There’s no reason—”</p>

<p>“How did it start?”</p>

<p>“It just … evolved. As things do. It took on a—”</p>

<p>“I don’t even care.”</p>

<p>“It never became anything other than words.”</p>

<p>“For how long?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Of course you do.”</p>

<p>“Maybe four months.”</p>

<p>“You’re asking me to believe that for four months you’ve been
exchanging sexually explicit texts with someone you work with every day and it
never led to anything physical?”</p>

<p>“I’m not asking you to believe me. I’m telling you the truth.”</p>

<p>“The sad thing is, I believe you.”</p>

<p>“That’s not sad. It’s hope.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s sad. You are the only person I know, or could even
imagine, who would be capable of writing such bold sentences while living so
meekly. I actually do believe that you could write to someone that you want to
lick her asshole, and have that bluff called, and then sit beside her every day
for an entire four months without allowing your hand to wander the six
necessary inches to her thigh. Without mustering that bravery. Without even
sending the signal that it’s OK for her to take up the slack of your cowardice
and move her hand onto your thigh. Think about the signals you must have been
sending to keep her pussy wet and her hand away.”</p>

<p>“That’s too far, Julia.”</p>

<p>“Too far? You’re serious? You are the person in this room who
doesn’t know what too far means.”</p>

<p>“I know that I went too far in what I wrote.”</p>

<p>“I’m telling you, you didn’t go far enough in what you lived.”</p>

<p>“What’s that supposed to mean? You want me to have an affair?”</p>

<p>“No, I want you to write Shabbat letters to me. But if you’re
going to write pornographic texts to someone else, then yes, I want you to have
an affair. Because then I could respect you.”</p>

<p>“You’re not making sense.”</p>

<p>“I’m making perfect sense. I would have respected you so much
more if you’d fucked her. It would have proven something to me that I have
found harder and harder to believe.”</p>

<p>“Which is?”</p>

<p>“That you’re a human being.”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe I’m human?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’re there at all.”</p>

<p>Jacob opened his mouth, without knowing what would come out. He
wanted to return everything she’d given to him, to catalog her neuroses, and
irrationalities, and weaknesses, and hypocrisies, and ugliness. He also wanted
to acknowledge that everything she’d said was true, but contextualize his
monstrousness—not all of it was his fault. He wanted to mortar bricks with one
hand while taking a hammer to them with the other.</p>

<p>But instead of his voice, they heard Benjy’s: “I need you! I
really need you!”</p>

<p>Julia released a burst of laughter.</p>

<p>“Why are you laughing?”</p>

<p>“It has nothing to do with things not being lost.”</p>

<p>It was the nervous laughter of oppositions. The dark laughter of
the knowledge of the end. The religious laughter of scale.</p>

<p>Benjy called out again through the monitor: “Someone! Someone!”</p>

<p>They fell silent.</p>

<p>Julia searched the darkness for her husband’s eyes, wanting to
search them.</p>

<p>“Someone!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE N-WORD</h2>

<p>Julia had fallen asleep by the time Jacob came back down from
calming Benjy. Or she did a perfectly believable impression of a sleeping
person. Jacob was restless. He didn’t want to read—not a book or a magazine,
not even a real estate blog. He didn’t want to watch TV. Writing wasn’t going
to happen. Neither was masturbation. No activity appealed to him, anything
would feel like an act, an impersonation of a person.</p>

<p>He went to Sam’s room, hoping for a few moments of peace,
observing his first child’s sleeping body. A shifting light spread from under
the door onto the hallway, then pulled back: waves from the digital ocean on
the other side. Sam, ever vigilant of his privacy, heard his father’s heavy
steps.</p>

<p>“Dad?”</p>

<p>“The one and lonely.”</p>

<p>“So … Are you standing there? Do you need something?”</p>

<p>“Can I come in?”</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer he opened the door.</p>

<p>“You were being rhetorical?” Sam asked, not looking away from
the screen.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I’m watching TV.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have a TV.”</p>

<p>“On my computer.”</p>

<p>“So aren’t you watching your computer?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“What’s on?”</p>

<p>“Everything.”</p>

<p>“What are you watching?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“You have a second?”</p>

<p>“Yes: one…”</p>

<p>“I was being rhetorical.”</p>

<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>“How’s it going?”</p>

<p>“Is this a conversation?”</p>

<p>“Just checking in.”</p>

<p>“I’m fine.”</p>

<p>“Does it feel great to feel fine?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think I heard it somewhere. So … Sam.”</p>

<p>“The one and bony.”</p>

<p>“Nice one. Anyway, listen. I’m sorry to have to get into this.
But. The thing at Hebrew school this morning.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Right. It’s just.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe me?”</p>

<p>“It’s not even a question of that.”</p>

<p>“Yes it is.”</p>

<p>“It would be a whole lot easier to get you out of this if you
had some other explanation.”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“A bunch of those words are really no big deal. Between us, it
wouldn’t even bother me if you had written them.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“But the n-word.”</p>

<p>Sam finally turned his attention to his father.</p>

<p>“What, divorce?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Never mind.”</p>

<p>“Why did you say that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Are you talking about Mom and me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I can’t even hear myself over the fighting and
glass-breaking.”</p>

<p>“Earlier? No, what you heard—”</p>

<p>“It’s OK. Mom came up and we had a talk.”</p>

<p>Jacob glanced at the TV on the computer. He thought about how
Guy de Maupassant ate lunch at the Eiffel Tower’s restaurant every day because
it was the only place in Paris without a view of the tower. The Nats were
playing the Dodgers, extra innings. With a sudden burst of excitement, he
clapped his hands. “Let’s go to the game tomorrow!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“So fun! We could get there early for batting practice. Eat tons
of shit.”</p>

<p>“Eat tons of shit?”</p>

<p>“Shitty food.”</p>

<p>“Would it be OK if I just watched this?”</p>

<p>“But I’m having an awesome idea.”</p>

<p>“Are you?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t I?”</p>

<p>“I have soccer, and cello, and bar mitzvah lessons, assuming
that’s still on, God forbid.”</p>

<p>“I can get you out of that.”</p>

<p>“My life?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can only bring you into that.”</p>

<p>“And they’re playing in L.A.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Jacob said, and quieter, “I should have realized that.”</p>

<p>That quietness made Sam wonder if maybe he’d hurt his father. He
experienced a tremor of a feeling that, despite knowing it was utterly foolish,
he would grow to experience more often and more strongly in the coming year:
that maybe everything was at least a little bit his fault.</p>

<p>“Finish the chess game?”</p>

<p>“Nah.”</p>

<p>“You’re OK with money?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“And this thing at Hebrew school. It obviously isn’t because of
Grandpa, right?”</p>

<p>“Not unless he’s also the grandfather of whoever did it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought. Anyway—”</p>

<p>“Dad, Billie’s black, so how could I be a racist?”</p>

<p>“Billie?”</p>

<p>“The girl I’m in love with.”</p>

<p>“You have a girlfriend?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’m confused.”</p>

<p>“She’s the girl I’m in love with.”</p>

<p>“OK. And you said Billie? But a girl, right?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And she’s black. So how could I be racist?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that logic quite works.”</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“You know who points out that some of his best friends are
black? Someone who isn’t comfortable with black people.”</p>

<p>“None of my best friends are black.”</p>

<p>“And for whatever it’s worth, I’m pretty sure African American
is the preferred nomenclature.”</p>

<p>“Nomenclature?”</p>

<p>“Terminology.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t the guy who’s in love with a black girl be the one
establishing the nomenclature?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the pot calling the kettle African American?”</p>

<p>“Pot?”</p>

<p>“I’m joking around. It’s an interesting name, that’s all. Not a judgment.
You know you were named for a great-great-uncle who perished in Birkenau. With
Jews there always has to be some significance attached.”</p>

<p>“Some suffering, you mean.”</p>

<p>“Gentiles pick names that sound nice. Or they just make them
up.”</p>

<p>“Billie was named after Billie Holiday.”</p>

<p>“So she’s the exception that proves the rule.”</p>

<p>“Who are you named after?” Sam asked, his interest a small
concession in response to the guilt of having forced his dad’s voice into quiet
sadness.</p>

<p>“A distant relative named Yakov. Supposedly an amazing,
larger-than-life guy. Story goes he crushed a Cossack’s head in his hand.”</p>

<p>“Cool.”</p>

<p>“I’m obviously not strong like that.”</p>

<p>“We don’t even know any Cossacks.”</p>

<p>“And at most, I’m the size of life.”</p>

<p>One of their stomachs grumbled, but neither knew whose.</p>

<p>“Well, bottom line, I think it’s awesome that you have a
girlfriend.”</p>

<p>“She’s not my girlfriend.”</p>

<p>“Nomenclature strikes twice. I think it’s awesome that you’re in
love.”</p>

<p>“I’m not in love. I love her.”</p>

<p>“Whatever’s going on, this obviously stays between us. You can
count on me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve already talked to Mom about it.”</p>

<p>“Really? When?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Couple of weeks ago?”</p>

<p>“This is old news?”</p>

<p>“It’s all relative.”</p>

<p>Jacob stared at Sam’s screen. Was this what drew Sam to it? Not
the ability to be elsewhere, but to be nowhere?</p>

<p>“What did you tell her?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Your mother?”</p>

<p>“You mean Mom?”</p>

<p>“That’s the one.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know, as in you don’t feel like talking about it with
me right now?”</p>

<p>“As in that.”</p>

<p>“It’s strange, because she’s convinced you wrote those words.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“OK. I’m becoming annoying. I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say you were annoying.”</p>

<p>Jacob moved to the door to leave, but paused. “Wanna hear a
joke?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It’s dirty.”</p>

<p>“Then definitely no.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference between a Subaru and an erection?”</p>

<p>“No means no.”</p>

<p>“Seriously. What’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“Seriously, not interested.”</p>

<p>Jacob leaned forward and whispered, “I don’t have a Subaru.”</p>

<p>Despite himself, Sam released a huge laugh, the kind involving
snorting and saliva. Jacob laughed, not at his own joke but at his son’s
laughter. They laughed together, vigorously, hysterically.</p>

<p>Sam struggled, without success, to regain his composure, and
said, “The funny thing … the really funny thing … is … you do have a Subaru.”</p>

<p>And then they laughed more, and Jacob spit a little, and teared
up, and remembered how horrible it was to be Sam’s age, how painful and unfair.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” Jacob said. “I totally have a Subaru. I should have
said Toyota. What was I thinking?”</p>

<p>“What were you thinking?”</p>

<p>What was he thinking?</p>

<p>They calmed down.</p>

<p>Jacob gave the sleeves of his shirt another roll—a bit tight,
but he wanted them over the elbow.</p>

<p>“Mom feels that you need to apologize.”</p>

<p>“Do you?”</p>

<p>In his pocket, he closed his hand around nothing, around a knife,
and said, “I do.”</p>

<p>The one and phony.</p>

<p>“OK, then,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“It won’t be that bad.”</p>

<p>“Yes it will.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Jacob said, kissing Sam on the top of his head—the last
kissable place. “It’s gonna suck.”</p>

<p>At the threshold, Jacob turned.</p>

<p>“How’s it going in Other Life?”</p>

<p>“Eh.”</p>

<p>“What are you working on?”</p>

<p>“Building a new synagogue.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Can I ask why?”</p>

<p>“Because I destroyed the old synagogue.”</p>

<p>“Destroyed? Like with a wrecking ball?”</p>

<p>“Like that.”</p>

<p>“So now you’re going to build one for yourself?”</p>

<p>“I built the old one, too.”</p>

<p>“Mom would love that,” Jacob said, understanding the brilliance
and beauty of what Sam never shared. “And she would probably have a million
ideas.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t mention it to her.”</p>

<p>That gave Jacob a spike of pleasure that he didn’t want. He
nodded and said, “Of course,” then shook his head and said, “I would never.”</p>

<p>“OK,” Sam said, “so, unless there’s something else?”</p>

<p>“And the old synagogue? Why did you build it?”</p>

<p>“So I could blow it up.”</p>

<p>“Blow it up? You know, if I were a different dad, and you were a
different kid, I’d probably feel obligated to report you to the FBI.”</p>

<p>“But if you were a different dad, and I were a different kid, I
wouldn’t have needed to blow up a virtual synagogue.”</p>

<p>“Touché,” Jacob said. “But isn’t it possible that you weren’t
building it to destroy? Or at least not only to destroy?”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t possible.”</p>

<p>“Like, maybe you were trying to get something exactly right, and
when it wasn’t, you needed to destroy it?”</p>

<p>“Nobody believes me.”</p>

<p>“I do. I believe that you want things to be right.”</p>

<p>“You just don’t get it,” Sam said, because there was no way he
was going to concede any understanding to his father. But his father got it.
Sam hadn’t built the synagogue to destroy it. He wasn’t one of those Tibetan
sand-mandala whatevers he’d been forced to hear about during a drive—five
silent guys working for thousands of hours on an arts and crafts project whose
function was to be functionless. (“And I used to think Nazis were the opposite
of Jews,” his dad had said, disconnecting his phone from the car stereo.) No,
he built the synagogue with the hope of feeling, finally, comfortable
somewhere. It wasn’t simply that he could create it to his own esoteric
specifications; he could be there without being there. Not unlike masturbating.
But as with masturbating, if it wasn’t exactly right, it was completely and
irretrievably wrong. Sometimes, at the worst possible moment, his drunken id
would suddenly veer, and in his mental headlights would be Rabbi Singer, or
Seal (the singer), or his mom. And there was never any coming back from that.
With the synagogue, too, the slightest imperfection—an infinitesimally
asymmetrical rotunda, stairs with risers too high for short kids, an
upside-down Jewish star—and it all had to go. He wasn’t being impulsive. He was
being careful. Couldn’t he simply have fixed what wasn’t right? No. Because he
would always know that it had been wrong: “That’s the star that once hung
upside down.” To another person, the correction would have made it more perfect
than if it had been right the first time. Sam was not another person. Neither
was Samanta.</p>

<p>Jacob sat on Sam’s bed and said, “When I was young, maybe in
high school, I used to like to write out the lyrics of all of my favorite
songs. I don’t know why. I guess it gave me that feeling of things being in the
right place. Anyway, this was long before the Internet. So I’d sit with my boom
box—”</p>

<p>“Your boom box?”</p>

<p>“A tape player with speakers.”</p>

<p>“I was being dismissive.”</p>

<p>“All right … well … I’d sit with my boom box and play a second
or two of a song, then write down what I’d heard, then rewind and play it again
to make sure I’d gotten it right, then let it play again, and write down a bit
more, then rewind for the parts I didn’t quite hear, or wasn’t sure I’d heard,
then write them down. Rewinding a tape is really imprecise, so I’d inevitably
go back too far, or not far enough. It was incredibly laborious. But I loved
it. I loved how careful it felt. I loved the feeling of getting it right. I
spent who knows how many thousands of hours doing that. Sometimes a lyric would
really stump me, especially when grunge and hip-hop came along. And I wouldn’t
accept guessing, because that would undermine the entire point of writing the
lyrics out—to get it right. Sometimes I’d have to listen to the same little bit
over and over and over, dozens of times, hundreds. I would literally wear
through that part of the tape, so that when I listened to the song later, the
part I most wanted to get right wasn’t there anymore. I remember a phrase in
‘All Apologies’—you know that song, right?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Nirvana? Great, great, great song. Anyway, Kurt Cobain’s
marbles seemed to have migrated to his mouth, and there was one phrase I had a
particularly hard time making out. My best guess, after hundreds of listenings,
was ‘I can see from shame.’ I didn’t realize I was wrong until many years
later, when I sang it, at the top of my lungs, like an idiot, with Mom. Not
long after we got married.”</p>

<p>“She pointed out that you were wrong?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“That’s so Mom.”</p>

<p>“I was grateful.”</p>

<p>“But you were singing.”</p>

<p>“Singing wrongly.”</p>

<p>“Still. She should have let it go.”</p>

<p>“No, she did the right thing.”</p>

<p>“So what was the real lyric?”</p>

<p>“Fasten your seat belt. It was: ‘aqua seafoam shame.’”</p>

<p>“No way.”</p>

<p>“Right?”</p>

<p>“What’s that even supposed to mean?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t mean anything. That was my mistake. I thought it had
to mean something.”</p>

<h1>II. LEARNING IMPERMANENCE</h1>

<h2>ANTIETAM</h2>

<p>Neither Jacob nor Julia knew what, exactly, was happening in
those first two weeks after Julia discovered the phone: what had been agreed
to, implied, broached hypothetically, asked for. Neither knew what was real. It
felt like there were so many emotional land mines; they moved through the hours
and rooms on their hearts’ tiptoes, with large earphones connected to sensitive
metal detectors that could pick up traces of buried feeling—if at the expense
of blocking out the rest of life.</p>

<p>At a breakfast that might, to a television audience, have seemed
in every way happy, Julia said into the fridge, “We’re always running out of
milk,” and through his earphones Jacob heard “You have never taken good enough
care of us,” but he didn’t hear Max say, “Don’t come to the talent show
tomorrow.”</p>

<p>And the next day, at Max’s school, forced to share the small
space of the elevator alone together, Jacob said, “The Door Close button isn’t
even attached to anything. Purely psychological.” Through her earphones, Julia
heard “Let’s get this over with.” But she didn’t hear herself say, “I thought
everything was purely psychological.” Which, through Jacob’s earphones, sounded
like “All of those years of therapy and no one knows less about happiness.” And
he didn’t hear himself say, “There’s pure, and there’s pure.” A probably
content parent in a probably unbroken family entered and asked Jacob if he
meant to be pressing Door Open.</p>

<p>All that tiptoeing, all that precious overinterpreting and
evading, and it wasn’t a minefield at all. It was a Civil War battlefield.
Jacob had taken Sam to Antietam, just as Irv had taken Jacob. And he had given
a similar speech about what a privilege it is to be American. Sam found a
half-buried bullet. The weapons in Jacob and Julia’s earth were as harmless as
that—artifacts of old battles, safe to be examined, explored, even valued. If
they’d known not to fear them.</p>

<p>The domestic rituals were sufficiently ingrained as to make
avoidance fairly easy and inconspicuous. She showered, he got breakfast going.
She served breakfast, he showered. He supervised teeth brushing, she laid
clothes out on beds, he confirmed the contents of the backpacks, she checked
the weather and responded to it with appropriate outer clothing, he got Ed the
Hyena going (warmed in the six months of too cold, cooled in the six months of
too hot), she brought the boys out and stepped into Newark to look for cars
coming down the hill, he reversed.</p>

<p>They found two seats near the front of the auditorium, but after
depositing his bag, Jacob said, “I’ll go grab us some coffees.” Which he did.
And then waited at the school entrance with them until three minutes of
curtain. Halfway through a girl’s talentless rendition of “Let It Go,” Jacob
whispered, “I wish she would,” into Julia’s ear. No response. A group of boys
reenacted a scene from Avatar. What was probably a girl used different kinds of
pasta to explain how the euro works. Neither Jacob nor Julia wanted to admit to
not knowing what Max was going to do. Neither could bear the shame of having
been too preoccupied with personal hurt to be present for their child. And
neither could bear the shame of the other having been a better parent. Each
privately guessed that Max would perform the card trick that the magician had
taught him after Julia’s fortieth. Two girls did that cup thing while singing
“When I’m Gone,” and Jacob whispered, “So go already.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“No. Her. The singer.”</p>

<p>“Be nice.”</p>

<p>For the finale, the drama and music teachers teamed up for a
sanitized version of the opener from The Book of Mormon—living out their dreams
while reconfirming why they were dreams. Lots of applause, a brief thank-you
from the principal, and the kids filed out and back to class.</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia walked back to their cars in silence. And the
talent show wasn’t mentioned at home that night. Had Max chickened out? Did he
consider himself talentless? Was his abstention an act of aggression or a call
for help? If they’d brought any of these questions to him, he would have
pointed out that he told them not to go.</p>

<p>Three nights later, when Jacob came to bed, after having waited
the requisite hour, Julia was still reading, so he said, “Oh, I forgot
something,” and headed back down to not read the paper while not watching
another episode of Homeland and regretting, as he often did, that Mandy
Patinkin wasn’t ten years older—he’d have made a great Irv.</p>

<p>Two days after that, Julia walked into the pantry, where Jacob
was checking to see if a few hundred billion atoms had spontaneously organized
themselves into an unhealthy snack in the ten minutes since he last checked.
She walked back out. (Unlike Jacob, she never gave an ostensible explanation
for moving away from him, she never “forgot something.”) The pantry wasn’t
among the unofficially claimed spaces—as the TV room was Jacob’s, and the small
sitting room was Julia’s—but it was too small to be shared.</p>

<p>On the tenth day, Jacob opened the bathroom door to see Julia
drying off after a bath. She covered herself. He had seen her come out of
hundreds of baths, seen three children come out of her body. He had watched her
dress and undress thousands and thousands of times, and twice at the inn in Pennsylvania.
They’d made love in every position, offering every view of every body part.
“Sorry,” he said, not knowing what the word referred to, only that his foot had
half depressed a mine’s trigger.</p>

<p>Or stumbled upon an artifact of old battle, which might have
been safe to examine, explore, even value.</p>

<p>What if, instead of apologizing and turning, he’d asked her if
the need to conceal herself was new, or old with a new justification?</p>

<p>When Robert E. Lee’s defensive line at Petersburg had been
broken and the evacuation of Richmond was imminent, Jefferson Davis ordered the
Confederate treasury be moved. It went by train, and then wagon, under many
eyes and between many hands. The Union pressed forward, the Confederacy
crumbled, and the whereabouts of the five tons of gold bars remain a mystery,
although they are assumed buried.</p>

<p>What if, instead of apologizing and turning, he’d gone to her,
touched her, shown her not only that he still wanted to make love to her, but
that he was still capable of risking rejection?</p>

<p>On Jacob’s first visit to Israel, his cousin Shlomo took the
family to the Dome of the Rock, which at the time could be entered by
non-Muslims. Jacob was as deeply moved by the devotion of the men on the prayer
rugs as he was by the Jews below. He was more moved, because the devotion was
less self-conscious: at the Wailing Wall the men merely bobbed; here they
wailed. Shlomo explained that they were standing atop a cave carved into the
Foundation Stone. And in the floor of that cave was a slight depression,
thought to be above another cave, often referred to as the Well of Souls. It
was there that Abraham answered God’s call, and prepared to sacrifice his
beloved son; there that Muhammad ascended to heaven; there that the Ark of the
Covenant was buried, full of broken and whole tablets. According to the Talmud,
the stone marks the center of the world, serving as a cover for the abyss in
which the waters from the Flood still rage.</p>

<p>“We are standing atop the greatest archaeological site that will
never be,” Shlomo said, “filled with the most valuable objects in the world,
the place where history and religion meet. All underground, never to be
touched.”</p>

<p>Irv was adamant that Israel should dig, come what may. It was a
cultural, historical, and intellectual obligation. But to Jacob, until those
things were unearthed—until they could be seen and touched—they would be
unreal. So it was better to keep them out of sight.</p>

<p>What if, instead of apologizing and turning, Jacob had gone to
Julia and lifted the towel, as he’d lifted her veil before the wedding,
confirming that she was still the woman she said she was, the woman he still
wanted?</p>

<p>Jacob tried to keep the conversations with Julia underground,
but she needed the end of their family to be seen and touched. She expressed
her continued respect for Jacob, her desire to be friends, best friends, and
good co-parents, the best, and to use a mediator and not get lost in all that
was not to be cared about, and to live around the corner from each other and go
on vacations together, and to dance at each other’s second weddings—although
she swore that she would never marry again. Jacob agreed, without believing
that any of what she said was either happening or would happen. They’d
experienced so many necessary passages—sleep-training the boys, teething, falls
from small bicycles, Sam’s physical therapy. This, too, would probably pass.</p>

<p>They could navigate the house to avoid each other, and they
could navigate conversations to maintain the illusion of safety, but there was
no underground when a child was in the room or the conversation. Many times,
Julia would catch sight of one of the boys—Benjy looking up in thought from a
drawing of Odysseus facing the Cyclops, Max examining the hairs on his forearm,
Sam carefully applying reinforcements as needed in his binder—and think, I
can’t.</p>

<p>And Jacob would think, We won’t.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>DAMASCUS</h2>

<p>The day before the beginning of the destruction of Israel, Julia
and Sam were scrambling to get their things together before the Uber driver,
Mohammed, was moved to give them a one-star rating, thereby sealing their fate
as haram passengers. Jacob was preparing Benjy, who was dressed like a pirate,
for a day with his grandparents.</p>

<p>“You have everything?” Julia asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, unable to muster the herculean effort to conceal
his annoyance at nothing.</p>

<p>“Don’t yes Mom,” Jacob said, for Julia’s benefit and his own.
Camaraderie had been hard to find in the past two weeks—not because there was
cruelty, just the absence of direct interaction. There had been a few moments,
usually triggered by a shared reflexive wonder at something one of the boys had
said or done, when it felt like Jacob and Julia were once again wearing the
same uniform. The day Oliver Sacks died, Jacob shared some of his hero’s life
with the boys, explaining the range of his interests, his closeted
homosexuality, his famous use of L-dopa with human produce, and how perhaps the
most curious and engaged person of the last fifty years spent more than thirty
of those years celibate.</p>

<p>“Celibate?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“Not having sex.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“So he was eager to take in everything the world had to offer,
but he didn’t want to, or couldn’t, share himself.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he was impotent,” Julia suggested.</p>

<p>“No,” Jacob said, feeling the wound open, “he just—”</p>

<p>“Or maybe he was patient.”</p>

<p>“I’m celibate,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“You?” Sam said. “You’re Wilt Chamberlain.”</p>

<p>“I’m not whoever that is, and I haven’t stuck my penis into
another person’s vagina hole.”</p>

<p>The defense of his celibacy was kind of funny. Referring to
“another person’s vagina hole” was kind of funny. But he said funnier, more
precocious things every few minutes. It didn’t feel like a metaphor, or
accidental wisdom. It didn’t scratch any exposed nerves. But for the first time
since she discovered the phone, it forced Julia’s eyes to meet Jacob’s. And in
that moment, he felt sure that they would find their way back.</p>

<p>But there wasn’t a lot of camaraderie now.</p>

<p>“What did I say?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>“It’s how you said it,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“How did I say whatever I said?”</p>

<p>“Like this,” Jacob said, imitating Sam’s Yes.</p>

<p>“I can handle my half of a conversation with my son,” Julia told
Jacob. Then she asked Sam, “Did you remember your toothbrush?”</p>

<p>“Of course he has his toothbrush,” Jacob said, making a small
allegiance correction.</p>

<p>“Shit,” Sam said, turning and hustling upstairs.</p>

<p>“He wanted you to chaperone,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“No. I don’t think that’s true.”</p>

<p>She picked up Benjy and said, “I’m going to miss you, my little
man.”</p>

<p>“Opi said I can say bad words at his house.”</p>

<p>“In his house, it’s his rules,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” Julia corrected.</p>

<p>“Shit, or penis…”</p>

<p>“Penis isn’t a bad word,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“I doubt Omi would like you talking like that.”</p>

<p>“Opi said it didn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“You misheard him.”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Omi doesn’t matter.’”</p>

<p>“He was joking,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Asshole is a bad word.”</p>

<p>Sam came back down the stairs with his toothbrush.</p>

<p>“Dress shoes?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>“Fuuuuuuck.”</p>

<p>“Fuck, too,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>Sam hustled back up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Maybe give him a bit more space?” Jacob suggested in the form
of a question ostensibly addressed to the collective consciousness.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I was being annoying.”</p>

<p>“Of course you weren’t. I just meant that Mark can play the bad
guy on the trip. If necessary.”</p>

<p>“Hopefully it won’t be.”</p>

<p>“Forty pubescents away from home?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t describe Sam as pubescent.”</p>

<p>“Pubescent?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“I’m glad Mark will be there,” Jacob said. “You know, you might
not even remember, but you said something about him, a couple of weeks ago, in
the context of—”</p>

<p>“I remember.”</p>

<p>“We said a lot of things.”</p>

<p>“We did.”</p>

<p>“I just wanted to say that.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure what you just said.”</p>

<p>“Just that.”</p>

<p>“Take the opportunity to get to know him a bit,” Julia said,
moving right along.</p>

<p>“Max?”</p>

<p>“Don’t just go off to your separate worlds.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have a world, so that shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be fun picking up the Israelis tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Will it?”</p>

<p>“You and Max can be Team America.”</p>

<p>Max came down the stairs. “Why are you talking about me?”</p>

<p>“We weren’t talking about you,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“I was just saying to Dad that you guys should try to find
things to do together while everyone’s away.”</p>

<p>The doorbell rang.</p>

<p>“My folks,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Together together?” Max whispered to Julia.</p>

<p>Jacob opened the door. Benjy wrestled himself free of Julia’s
arms and ran to Deborah.</p>

<p>“Omi!”</p>

<p>“Hey, Omi,” Max said.</p>

<p>“I’ve got Ebola?” Irv asked.</p>

<p>“Ebola?”</p>

<p>“Hey, Opi.”</p>

<p>“Cool Moshe Dayan outfit.”</p>

<p>“I’m a pirate.”</p>

<p>Irv lowered himself to Benjy’s level and performed what might
very well have been a perfect Dayan impression, if anyone had known what Dayan
sounded like: “The Syrians will soon learn that the road from Damascus to
Jerusalem also goes from Jerusalem to Damascus!”</p>

<p>“Arrrgggg!”</p>

<p>“I wrote up his schedule,” Julia said to Deborah. “And put
together a bag with a few prepared meals.”</p>

<p>“I’ve prepared a meal or two million in my day.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Julia said, trying to reciprocate Deborah’s obvious
affection. “I just want to make it as easy as possible.”</p>

<p>“I have a freezer full of very frozen foods,” Deborah told
Benjy.</p>

<p>“Morningstar Farms veggie bacon strips?”</p>

<p>“Hm.”</p>

<p>“Fuuuuuuck.”</p>

<p>“Benjy!”</p>

<p>Sam came running down the stairs with his shoes, paused, said,
“Goddamn it!” and turned back around.</p>

<p>“Language,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Dad says there’s no bad language.”</p>

<p>“I said there’s bad usage. And that was bad usage.”</p>

<p>“Are we gonna burn the midnight oil?” Irv asked Benjy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Not too late,” Julia told Deborah.</p>

<p>“And tomorrow we’ll fetch the Israelis?”</p>

<p>“I’m taking him to the zoo,” Deborah said. “Remember?”</p>

<p>Irv held up his phone: “Siri, do I remember what this woman is
talking about?”</p>

<p>Sam came running back down the stairs with a belt.</p>

<p>“Hey, kid,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“Hey, Opi. Hey, Omi.”</p>

<p>“All’s copacetic with your hate speech?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“You know, I once chaperoned your dad’s class on a Model UN
trip.”</p>

<p>“No you didn’t,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Sure I did.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Irv said, winking at Sam. “I’m thinking of the
time I took you to the actual UN.” And then, slapping his own hand: “Bad
father.”</p>

<p>“You forgot me there.”</p>

<p>“Obviously not permanently.” And then, to Sam: “Ready to give
’em hell?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Remember, if they seat a delegate from so-called Palestine, you
tell them what’s what, then get up and walk out. You hear me? Punch with your
mouth, and talk with your feet.”</p>

<p>“We’re representing Micronesia—”</p>

<p>“Siri, what is Micronesia?”</p>

<p>“And we, you know, debate resolutions, and respond to whatever
crisis they manufacture.”</p>

<p>“They the Arabs?”</p>

<p>“The facilitators.”</p>

<p>“He knows what he’s doing, Dad.”</p>

<p>Three full honks, followed by nine rapid blasts—Shevarim,
Teruah.</p>

<p>“Mohammed is losing patience,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“And it was never his forte,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“We’ll go, too,” Deborah said. “We have a big day planned: story
time, arts and crafts, a nature walk—”</p>

<p>“—eat jelly fruit slices, make fun of Charlie Rose…”</p>

<p>“Come on, Argus!” Jacob called.</p>

<p>“I want to marry jelly fruit slices.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to the vet,” Max explained to Deborah.</p>

<p>“Everything’s fine,” Jacob said, alleviating concern that
belonged to no one.</p>

<p>“Except he poops in the house twice every day,” Max said.</p>

<p>“He’s old. It’s convention.”</p>

<p>“Does Great-Grandpa poop in the house twice every day?” Benjy
asked.</p>

<p>Silence as everyone privately acknowledged that, as their visits
had become so rare, it was impossible to rule out the possibility that Isaac
pooped in the house twice a day.</p>

<p>“Actually, doesn’t everyone poop in the house twice a day?”
Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“Your brother means in the house, but not in the bathroom.”</p>

<p>“He has a colostomy bag,” Irv said. “Wherever he goes, there his
poop is.”</p>

<p>“What’s a whatever bag?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>Jacob cleared his throat and began: “Great-Grandpa’s
intestines—”</p>

<p>“Like a doggie bag for his crap,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“But why would he want to eat it later?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“Maybe someone could check in on him while we’re away,” Julia
said. “You could even bring the Israelis by on the way home.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was planning,” Jacob lied.</p>

<p>Mohammed honked again, this time with the sustain pedal.</p>

<p>Everyone headed out together: Deborah, Irv, and Benjy off to a
marionette Pinocchio at Glen Echo; Julia and Sam to catch the bus from school;
Jacob, Max, and Argus to the vet. Julia hugged Max and Benjy, and didn’t hug
Jacob, but told him: “Don’t forget to—”</p>

<p>“Go,” he said. “Have fun. Make world peace.”</p>

<p>“A lasting peace,” Julia said, the words having organized
themselves.</p>

<p>“And say hi to Mark for me. Really.”</p>

<p>“Not now, OK?”</p>

<p>“You’re hearing something I didn’t say.”</p>

<p>A curt “Goodbye.”</p>

<p>Halfway down the stoop, Benjy called back: “What if I don’t miss
you?”</p>

<p>“You can call us,” Jacob said. “My phone will always be on, and
I’ll never be more than a short drive away.”</p>

<p>“I said what if I don’t miss you?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Is that OK?”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s OK,” Julia said, giving Benjy a last kiss.
“Nothing would make me happier than for you to have so much fun you don’t think
about us at all.”</p>

<p>Jacob came down the stairs to give Benjy the last, last kiss.</p>

<p>“And anyway,” he said, “you’ll miss us.”</p>

<p>And then, for the first time in his life, Benjy chose not to
voice a thought.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE SIDE THAT FACES AWAY</h2>

<p>They stopped at McDonald’s on the way. It was a vet visit
ritual, something Jacob started doing after hearing a podcast about a shelter
in L.A. that euthanized more dogs than anywhere else in America. The woman who
ran it put down each and every dog herself, sometimes a dozen a day. She called
each by its name, gave each as good a walk as it could handle, talked to it,
stroked it, and, as a final gesture before the needle, fed it McNuggets. As she
put it, “It’s the last meal they would ask for.”</p>

<p>Argus’s visits in the past couple of years had been for joint
pain, eye cloudiness, fatty lumps on the belly, and incontinence. They weren’t
suggestive of an imminent end, but Jacob knew how nervous the vet’s office made
him and felt that he owed his pal a reward, which might also serve as a
positive association. Whether or not he would have chosen them as his last
meal, Argus tore through the McNuggets, swallowing most of them whole. For as
long as he’d been a member of the Bloch family, he had eaten Newman’s Own twice
a day without any variation. (Julia militantly banned table scraps, as they
would “force Argus to become a beggar.”) The McNuggets always led to diarrhea,
sometimes vomiting. But that usually took a few hours, which could be timed to
coincide with a walk in the park. And it was worth it.</p>

<p>Jacob and Max got McNuggets for themselves, too. They almost
never ate meat in the house—again, Julia’s decision—and fast food ranked just
below cannibalism on the list of things not to be done. Neither Jacob nor Max
missed McNuggets, but sharing something Julia disapproved of was a bonding
experience. They pulled over at Fort Reno Park and made an impromptu picnic.
Argus was loyal enough, and lethargic enough, to be trusted off-leash. Max
stroked him as he swallowed McNugget after McNugget, telling him, “You’re a
good dog. You’re good. You’re good.”</p>

<p>Pathetic as it felt, Jacob was jealous. Julia’s cruel
comments—however accurate, however deserved—lingered painfully in his mind. He
kept returning to the line “I don’t believe you’re there at all.” It was among
the least specific, least pointed things she’d said in the course of their
first fight about the phone, and a different person’s mind would probably have
attached itself to something else. But that was what echoed: “I don’t believe
you’re there at all.”</p>

<p>“I used to come here a lot when I was younger,” Jacob said to
Max. “We’d sled down that hill.”</p>

<p>“Who was we?”</p>

<p>“Usually friends. Grandpa might have taken me a couple times,
though I don’t remember it. When it was warm, I’d come here to play baseball.”</p>

<p>“Games? Or just goofing around?”</p>

<p>“Mostly goofing. It was never easy to get a minyan. Sometimes.
Maybe the last day of school before a break.”</p>

<p>“You’re good, Argus. So good.”</p>

<p>“When I got older, we’d buy beer from the Tenleytown
Grocery—just over there. They never carded us.”</p>

<p>“What’s that mean?”</p>

<p>“You have to be twenty-one to buy beer legally, so usually
places will ask for ID, like a driver’s license, to see how old you are.
Tenleytown never did. So we all bought beer there.”</p>

<p>“You were breaking the law.”</p>

<p>“It was a different time. And you know what Martin Luther King said
about just and unjust laws.”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Basically, it was our moral responsibility to buy the beer.”</p>

<p>“Good Argus.”</p>

<p>“I’m kidding, of course. It is not good to buy beer before
you’re of age, and please don’t tell Mom that I told you that story.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what a minyan is?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ask?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“It’s ten men over the age of thirteen. That’s what’s required
for prayers to count at synagogue.”</p>

<p>“Sounds sexist and ageist.”</p>

<p>“Definitely both,” Jacob said, pulling a wildflower. “Fugazi
used to play a free show here every summer.”</p>

<p>“What’s Fugazi?”</p>

<p>“Only the greatest band ever to have existed, by any definition
of great. Their music was great. Their ethos was great. They were just great.”</p>

<p>“What’s ethos?”</p>

<p>“Guiding belief.”</p>

<p>“What was their ethos?”</p>

<p>“Don’t price-gouge your fans, don’t tolerate violence at shows,
don’t make videos or sell merchandise. Do make music with anticorporate,
antimisogynist, class-conscious messaging, and make it make your face melt.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good dog.”</p>

<p>“We should probably get going.”</p>

<p>“My ethos is ‘Find light in the beautiful sea, I choose to be
happy.’”</p>

<p>“That’s a great ethos, Max.”</p>

<p>“It’s a line from a Rihanna song.”</p>

<p>“Well, Rihanna is wise.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t write the song.”</p>

<p>“Whoever wrote it.”</p>

<p>“Sia.”</p>

<p>“So Sia’s wise.”</p>

<p>“And I was just kidding.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Ethos.”</p>

<p>“Don’t price-gouge your fans, don’t tolerate violence at shows—”</p>

<p>“No, seriously.”</p>

<p>Jacob laughed.</p>

<p>“Seriously,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Let me think about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s probably your ethos.”</p>

<p>“That’s Hamlet’s ethos. You know Hamlet, right?”</p>

<p>“I’m ten, I’m not unborn.”</p>

<p>“Sorry.”</p>

<p>“Also, Sam’s reading it in class.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where Fugazi is now. I wonder if they’re still
idealistic, whatever they’re doing.”</p>

<p>“You’re good, Argus.”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>When they got to the vet’s office, they were led to an examining
room in the back.</p>

<p>“In a weird way this reminds me of Great-Grandpa’s house.”</p>

<p>“That is weird.”</p>

<p>“All the photos of the dogs are kind of like the pictures of me,
Sam, and Benjy. And the jar of treats is like the jar of hard candies.”</p>

<p>“And it smells like…”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I was going to say death, but it didn’t feel like a nice thing
to say, so I tried to keep it to myself.”</p>

<p>“What does death smell like?”</p>

<p>“Like this.”</p>

<p>“How do you even know?”</p>

<p>Jacob had never smelled a dead person. His three dead
grandparents had died either before he was born or early enough in his
childhood for him to have been protected from it. None of his colleagues or
friends, or former colleagues or former friends, had died. Sometimes it amazed
him that he’d managed to live forty-two years without proximity to mortality.
And that amazement was always followed by the fear that the statistics would
catch up with him and offer a lot of death at once. And he wouldn’t be ready.</p>

<p>The vet took half an hour to see them, and Max gave Argus treat
after treat.</p>

<p>“Might not mix well with the McNuggets,” Jacob warned.</p>

<p>“You’re good. You’re so good.”</p>

<p>Argus brought out a different side of Max, a sweetness, or
vulnerability, that usually faced away. Jacob thought about a day he spent with
his father at the National Museum of Natural History when he was Max’s age. He
had so few memories of time alone with his father—Irv worked long hours at the
magazine, and when he wasn’t writing, he was teaching, and when he wasn’t
teaching, he was socializing with important people, to confirm that he was an
important person—but Jacob remembered that day.</p>

<p>They were facing a diorama. A bison.</p>

<p>“Nice,” Irv said, “right?”</p>

<p>“Really nice,” Jacob said, moved—shaken, even—by the extreme presence
of the animal, how self-contained it was.</p>

<p>“None of this is by accident,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“They go to lengths to re-create an accurate nature scene.
That’s the point. But there are a lot of accurate scenes they could have
chosen, right? The bison could have been galloping instead of standing still.
He could have been battling, or hunting, or eating. There could have been two
instead of one. They could have perched a small bird on his back. A lot of
choices.”</p>

<p>Jacob used to love being taught by his father. It felt
intoxicating, and safe. And it confirmed that Jacob was an important person in
his father’s life.</p>

<p>“But the choices aren’t always made freely,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because they have to hide what brought the animals here.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Where do you think the animals come from?”</p>

<p>“Africa, or something?”</p>

<p>“But how do they end up in dioramas? Do you think they volunteer
to be taxidermied? Are they roadkill that lucky scientists stumble upon?”</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“They’re hunted.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“And hunting isn’t clean.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t?”</p>

<p>“No one ever got something that didn’t want to be gotten without
making a mess.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“Bullets leave holes, sometimes big ones. Arrows, too. And you
don’t bring down a bison with a little hole.”</p>

<p>“I guess not.”</p>

<p>“So when they position the animals in the dioramas, they turn
the holes and gashes and tears away from the viewer. Only the animals painted
into the landscape get to see them. But remembering they’re there changes
everything.”</p>

<p>Once, after hearing Jacob recount an example of Julia’s subtle
belittling, Dr. Silvers said, “Most people behave badly when wounded. If you
can remember the wounds, it is far more possible to forgive the behavior.”</p>

<p>Julia was in the bath when he’d come home that night. He tried—with
gentle knocking, calling into the room, and unnecessarily loud shuffling—to
make her aware of his presence, but the water was too loud, and opening the
door, he startled her. After catching her breath, and laughing at her fear, she
rested her chin on the tub’s lip. They listened to the water together. A
seashell brought to the ear becomes an echo chamber for one’s circulatory
system. The ocean you hear is your own blood. The bathroom that night was an
echo chamber for their shared life. And behind Julia, where the towels and
hanging robe should have been, Jacob saw a painted landscape, a flat forever
occupied by a school, a soccer field, the Whole Foods bulk section (a grid of
plastic bins filled with painted split peas and brown rice, dried mango and raw
cashews), a Subaru and a Volvo, a home, their home, and through a second-story
window there was a room, so tiny and precisely painted, only a Master could
have made it, and on a table in that room, which became her office once there
was no more need for a nursery, was an architectural model, a house, and in
that house in that house in the house in which life happened was a woman,
carefully positioned.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Finally, the vet came. She wasn’t what Jacob was anticipating,
or hoping for: some gentle, gentile, grandfather figure. To begin with, she was
a she. In Jacob’s experience, vets were like airplane pilots: virtually always
male, gray (or graying), and calming. Dr. Shelling looked too young to buy
Jacob a drink—not that the situation would ever arise—was fit, firm, and
wearing what appeared to be a tailored lab coat.</p>

<p>“What brings you here today?” she asked, riffling through
Argus’s chart.</p>

<p>Did Max see what Jacob saw? Was he old enough to pay any
attention? To be embarrassed?</p>

<p>“He’s been having some problems,” Jacob said, “probably just
normal stuff for a dog of his age: incontinence, some joint issues. Our
previous vet—Dr. Hazel at Animal Kind—put him on Rimadyl and Cosequin, and said
we should consider adjusting the dosage if things didn’t improve. They didn’t
improve, and we doubled the dosage, and added a dementia pill, but nothing
happened. So I thought we’d seek another opinion.”</p>

<p>“OK,” she said, putting down the clipboard. “And this dog has a
name?”</p>

<p>“Argus,” Max offered.</p>

<p>“Great name,” she said, lowering herself onto a knee.</p>

<p>She held the sides of Argus’s face, and looked into his eyes
while she stroked his head.</p>

<p>“He’s in pain,” Max said.</p>

<p>“He has occasional discomfort,” Jacob clarified. “But it’s not
constant, and it’s not pain.”</p>

<p>“Are you in pain?” Dr. Shelling asked Argus.</p>

<p>“He whines when he gets up and down,” Max said.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound good.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll also whine if we don’t drop enough popcorn during
movies,” Jacob said. “He’s a catholic whiner.”</p>

<p>“Can you think of other times he whines out of discomfort?”</p>

<p>“Again, almost all of his whining is for food or a walk. But
that’s not pain, or even discomfort. Just desire.”</p>

<p>“He whines when you and Mom fight.”</p>

<p>“That’s Mom’s whining,” Jacob said, trying to relieve the shame
he felt in front of the veterinarian.</p>

<p>“Does he get enough walks?” she asked. “He shouldn’t be whining
for a walk.”</p>

<p>“He gets a lot of walks,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Three,” Max said.</p>

<p>“A dog of Argus’s age needs five walks. At least.”</p>

<p>“Five walks a day?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“And the pain you’ve witnessed. For how long has it been going
on?”</p>

<p>“Discomfort,” Jacob corrected. “Pain is too strong a word.”</p>

<p>“A long time,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Not that long. Maybe half a year?”</p>

<p>“It’s gotten bad in the last half a year,” Max said, “but he’s
been whining since Benjy was like three.”</p>

<p>“Same could be said of Benjy.”</p>

<p>The vet looked into Argus’s eyes for another few moments, now in
silence. Jacob wanted to be looked at like that.</p>

<p>“OK,” she said. “Let’s take a temperature, I’ll check his
vitals, and if it feels right, we can do some blood work.”</p>

<p>She pulled a thermometer from a glass bottle on the counter,
squeezed some lube onto it, and positioned herself behind Argus. Did it thrill
Jacob? Did it depress him? It depressed him. But why? Because of Argus’s
stoicism whenever this happened? How it reminded him of his own unwillingness,
or inability, to show discomfort? No, it had to do with the vet—her youthful
beauty (she seemed to be reverse-aging as the visit progressed), but more, her
tender care. She inspired fantasizing in Jacob, but not about a sexual
encounter. Not even about her guiding in a suppository. He imagined her
pressing a stethoscope to his chest; her fingers gently exploring the glands of
his neck; how she would extend and bend his arms and legs, listening for the
difference between discomfort and pain with the closeness and quietness and
care of someone trying to crack a safe.</p>

<p>Max got down on a knee, placed his face in front of Argus’s, and
said, “That’s my boy. Look at me. There you go, boy.”</p>

<p>“OK,” she said, removing the thermometer. “A little high, but
within the healthy range.”</p>

<p>She then ran her hands over Argus’s body, examining the insides
of his ears, lifting his lip to look at the teeth and gums, pressing Argus’s
belly, rotating his thigh until he whined.</p>

<p>“Sensitive on that leg.”</p>

<p>“He had both of his hips replaced,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Total hip replacements?”</p>

<p>Jacob shrugged.</p>

<p>“The left was a femoral head osteotomy,” Max said.</p>

<p>“That’s an interesting choice.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Max went on, “he was on the border in terms of weight,
and the vet thought we could spare him the THR. But it was a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like you were paying pretty close attention.”</p>

<p>“He’s my dog,” Max said.</p>

<p>“OK,” she said, “he’s obviously got some tenderness. Probably a
bit of arthritis.”</p>

<p>“He’s been pooping in the house for about a year,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Not a year,” Jacob corrected.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember Sam’s slumber party?”</p>

<p>“Right, but that was unusual. It didn’t become a consistent
problem until several months after that.”</p>

<p>“And is he also urinating in the house?”</p>

<p>“Mostly just defecating,” Jacob said, “some peeing more
recently.”</p>

<p>“Does he still squat to poop? Often it’s really an arthritic
problem, rather than an intestinal or rectal one—the dog can no longer assume
the position, and so poops while walking.”</p>

<p>“He often poops while walking,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“But sometimes he’ll poop in his bed,” Max said.</p>

<p>“As if he doesn’t realize he’s pooping,” the vet suggested. “Or
simply has no control.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Max said. “I don’t know if dogs get embarrassed, or
sad, but.”</p>

<p>Jacob received a text from Julia: made it to the hotel.</p>

<p>“We’ll never know,” the vet said, “but it definitely doesn’t
sound pleasant.”</p>

<p>That’s it? Jacob thought. Made it to the hotel? As if to a
tolerated colleague, or the most minimal communication required to satisfy a
legal obligation. And then he thought, Why does she always give me so little?
And that thought surprised him, not just the flash flood of anger it rode in
on, but how comfortable it felt—and that word, always—despite his never before
having consciously thought it. Why does she always give me so little? So little
of the benefit of the doubt. So few compliments. Such rare appreciation. When
was the last time she didn’t stifle a laugh at one of his jokes? When did she
last ask to read what he was working on? When did she last initiate sex? So
little to live off. He’d behaved badly, but only after a decade of wounds from
arrows too blunt to get the job done.</p>

<p>He often thought of that piece by Andy Goldsworthy, for which he
lay flat on the ground as a storm came in, and remained there until it passed.
When he stood up, his dry silhouette remained. Like the chalk outline of a
victim. Like the unpunctured circle where the dartboard used to be.</p>

<p>“He still enjoys himself at the park,” Jacob said to the vet.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I was just saying that he still enjoys himself at the park.”</p>

<p>And with that seeming non sequitur, the conversation rotated 180
degrees, so that the other side faced front.</p>

<p>“Sometimes he does,” Max said. “But mostly he just lies there.
And he has such a hard time with the stairs at home.”</p>

<p>“He ran the other day.”</p>

<p>“And then limped for like the next three days.”</p>

<p>“Look,” Jacob said, “obviously his quality of life is
diminishing. Obviously he’s not the dog he used to be. But he has a life worth
living.”</p>

<p>“Says who?”</p>

<p>“Dogs don’t want to die.”</p>

<p>“Great-Grandpa does.”</p>

<p>“Whoa, wait. What did you just say?”</p>

<p>“Great-Grandpa wants to die,” Max said matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>“Great-Grandpa isn’t a dog.” The full strangeness of that
comment started to creep up the walls of the room. Jacob tried to cut it back
with the obvious amendment: “And he doesn’t want to die.”</p>

<p>“Says who?”</p>

<p>“Would you two like a little time?” the vet asked, crossing her
arms and taking a long backward stride toward the door.</p>

<p>“Great-Grandpa has hopes for the future,” Jacob said. “Like
living to see Sam’s bar mitzvah. And he takes pleasure in memories.”</p>

<p>“Same as Argus.”</p>

<p>“You think Argus is looking forward to Sam’s bar mitzvah?”</p>

<p>“No one is looking forward to Sam’s bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“Great-Grandpa is.”</p>

<p>“Says who?”</p>

<p>“Dogs take all kinds of very subtle pleasure in life,” the vet
said. “Lying in a patch of sun. The occasional bit of tasty human food. It’s
hard to say how far their mental experience extends beyond that. It’s left to
us to make assumptions.”</p>

<p>“Argus feels like we forgot him,” Max said, making his
assumption clear.</p>

<p>“Forgot him?”</p>

<p>“Just like Great-Grandpa.”</p>

<p>Jacob gave the vet a ruffled smile and said, “Who said
Great-Grandpa feels forgotten?”</p>

<p>“He does.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“When we talk.”</p>

<p>“And when is that?”</p>

<p>“When we skype.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t mean it.”</p>

<p>“So how do you know Argus means it when he whines?”</p>

<p>“Dogs can’t not mean things.”</p>

<p>“Tell him,” Max said to the vet.</p>

<p>“Tell him what?”</p>

<p>“Tell him that Argus should be put to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Oh. That’s not for me to say. It’s a very personal decision.”</p>

<p>“OK, but if you thought he shouldn’t be put to sleep, you would
have just said he shouldn’t be put to sleep.”</p>

<p>“He runs in the park, Max. He watches movies on the sofa.”</p>

<p>“Tell him,” Max said to the vet.</p>

<p>“My job, as a vet, is to care for Argus, to help keep him healthy.
It isn’t to offer advice about end-of-life decisions.”</p>

<p>“So in other words, you agree with me.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say that, Max.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p>“Do you think my great-grandfather should be put to sleep?”</p>

<p>“No,” the vet said, immediately regretting the credence her
response lent the question.</p>

<p>“Tell him.”</p>

<p>“Tell him what?”</p>

<p>“Tell him that you think Argus should be put to sleep.”</p>

<p>“That’s really not for me to say.”</p>

<p>“See?” Max said to his father.</p>

<p>“You realize Argus is in the room, Max?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Of course he understands.”</p>

<p>“So hold on. You think Argus understands, but Great-Grandpa
doesn’t?”</p>

<p>“Great-Grandpa understands.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re a monster.”</p>

<p>“Max.”</p>

<p>“Tell him.”</p>

<p>Argus vomited a dozen almost perfectly formed McNuggets at the vet’s
feet.</p>

<p>“How do they keep the glass clean?” Jacob had asked his father,
three decades before.</p>

<p>Irv gave a puzzled look and said, “Windex?”</p>

<p>“I mean the other side. People can’t walk in there. They’d ruin
all the stuff on the ground.”</p>

<p>“But if no one ever goes in, it stays clean.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t,” Jacob said. “Remember when we came back from
Israel and everything was dirty? Even though no one had been there for three
weeks? Remember how we wrote our names in Hebrew in the dust on the windows?”</p>

<p>“A house isn’t a closed environment.”</p>

<p>“Yes it is.”</p>

<p>“Not as closed as a diorama.”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>The only thing Irv loved more than teaching Jacob was being
challenged by him: the intimations of one day being surpassed by his child.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s why they face that side of the glass away,” he
said, smiling, but hiding his fingers in his son’s hair, which, given enough
time, would grow to bury them.</p>

<p>“I don’t think glass works like that.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“You can’t hide the other side.”</p>

<p>“Do animals work like that?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Look at the face of that bison.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Look closely.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>NOT YET</h2>

<p>Sam and Billie sat in the back of the bus, several empty rows
behind the rest.</p>

<p>“I want to show you something,” she said.</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“On your iPad.”</p>

<p>“I left it at home.”</p>

<p>“Seriously?”</p>

<p>“My mom made me,” Sam said, wishing he’d invented a less
infantilizing explanation.</p>

<p>“Did she read an op-ed, or something?”</p>

<p>“She wants me to be ‘present’ on the trip.”</p>

<p>“What uses ten gallons of gas but doesn’t move?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A Buddhist monk.”</p>

<p>Sam laughed, not getting it.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen the one where the alligator bites the electric
eel?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s fucking nuts.”</p>

<p>Billie took out the generic, lamer-than-an-adult-on-a-scooter
tablet her parents got her for Christmas, and started typing. “Have you seen
the weatherman with the hard-on?”</p>

<p>They watched together and laughed.</p>

<p>“The best part is when he says, ‘We’re looking at a hot one.’”</p>

<p>She loaded a new video and said, “Check out the syphilis on this
guinea pig.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s a hamster.”</p>

<p>“You’re missing the genital sores for the trees.”</p>

<p>“I hate to sound like my dad, but isn’t it insane that we have
access to this shit?”</p>

<p>“It’s not insane. It’s the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, then isn’t the world insane?”</p>

<p>“Definitionally it can’t be. Insane is what other people are.”</p>

<p>“I really, really like how you think.”</p>

<p>“I really, really like that you would say that.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying it; it’s true.”</p>

<p>“And another thing I really, really like is that you can’t bring
yourself to say the l-word, because you’re afraid I’ll think you’re saying
something you aren’t.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Really, really, really like.”</p>

<p>He loved her.</p>

<p>She put the tablet in a coma and said, “Emet hi hasheker hatov
beyoter.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Hebrew.”</p>

<p>“You speak Hebrew?”</p>

<p>“As Franz Rosenzweig famously responded when asked if he was
religious, ‘Not yet.’ But I figured one of us should learn a bit in honor of
your bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“Franz who? And wait, what’s it mean?”</p>

<p>“Truth is the safest lie.”</p>

<p>“Ah. Well: Anata wa subete o rikai shite iru baai wa, gokai suru
hitsuyo ga arimasu.”</p>

<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>

<p>“‘If you understand everything, you must be misinformed.’
Japanese, I think. It was the epigraph to Call of Duty: Black Ops.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I study Japanese on Thursdays. I just didn’t understand
your usage.”</p>

<p>Sam wanted to show her the new synagogue he’d been working on
for the past two weeks. He wondered if it was the best expression of the best
of him, and he wondered if she’d like it.</p>

<p>The bus pulled up to the Washington Hilton—the hotel at which
Sam’s bar mitzvah party would theoretically take place in two weeks, if an
apology could be wrested from him—and the kids disembarked and scattered.
Inside the lobby hung a large banner: WELCOME 2016 MODEL UNITED NATIONS. A few
dozen suitcases and duffels were piled in the corner, nearly every one
containing something it wasn’t supposed to. While Mark struggled to do a head
count, Sam pulled his mother aside.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a big deal when you talk to everyone, OK?”</p>

<p>“A big deal about what?”</p>

<p>“About anything. Just don’t make a big deal.”</p>

<p>“You’re worried that I’m going to embarrass you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You made me say it.”</p>

<p>“Sam, we’re here to have a blast—”</p>

<p>“Don’t say blast.”</p>

<p>“—and the absolute last thing I’d want to be is a drag.”</p>

<p>“Or drag.”</p>

<p>Mark gave Julia a thumbs-up, and she addressed the group: “Can I
have everyone’s attention?”</p>

<p>Everyone withheld his attention.</p>

<p>“Yoo-hoo!”</p>

<p>“Or yoo-hoo,” Sam whispered to no one.</p>

<p>Mark unleashed a baritone that made charm bracelets into wind
chimes: “Mouths shut, eyes up here, now!”</p>

<p>The kids silenced.</p>

<p>“OK,” Julia said. “Well, as you probably know, I’m Sam’s mom. He
told me not to make a big deal, so I’ll keep this to the essentials. First, I
want to let you all know how totally psyched I am to be here with you.”</p>

<p>Sam closed his eyes, willing himself to unlearn object
permanence.</p>

<p>“This is going to be interesting, challenging, and awesome.”</p>

<p>Julia saw Sam’s closed eyes but didn’t know what she’d done.</p>

<p>“So … just a bit of housekeeping before passing out room keys,
which I believe are cards and not keys, but we’ll call them keys. You’ll find
that I’m a very laid-back person. But laid-backness is a two-way street. I know
you guys are here to enjoy yourselves, but remember that you’re also
representatives of Georgetown Day School, not to mention our archipelago home,
the Federated States of Micronesia!”</p>

<p>She waited for applause. Or anything. Billie filled the silence
with a single clap, and then she was holding the hot potato of awkwardness.</p>

<p>Julia continued: “So, I’m sure it goes without saying, but
recreational drug use isn’t going to happen.”</p>

<p>Sam lost muscle control of his neck, his head slumping forward.</p>

<p>“If you have a prescription for something, of course that’s
fine, so long as it isn’t used recreationally or otherwise abused. Now, I
realize most of you aren’t even thirteen, but I also want to broach the subject
of sexual relations.”</p>

<p>Sam walked to the side. Billie followed him.</p>

<p>Mark saw what was happening and intervened: “I think what Mrs.
Bloch is trying to say is, don’t do anything you wouldn’t want us to tell your
parents about. Because we’ll tell your parents about it, and then you’ll be in
deep shit. Got it?”</p>

<p>The students collectively affirmed.</p>

<p>“My mother is why Kurt Cobain killed himself,” Sam whispered to
Billie.</p>

<p>“Cut her some slack.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>As Mark handed out key cards, he said, “Take your stuff to your
rooms, unpack, and don’t turn on the TV, and don’t have anything to do with the
minibar. We’ll meet at my room, eleven twenty-four, at two o’clock. If you have
a device, input it: eleven twenty-four at two. If you don’t have a device, try
your brain. Now, being smart and motivated young people, you will use this time
to go over position papers so you’re sharp for this afternoon’s minisessions.
You have my cell number in case, and only in case, something comes up. Know
that I am omniscient. Which is to say, even without being physically present, I
can see and hear everything. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>The kids took their key cards and dispersed.</p>

<p>“And for you,” Mark said, handing Julia her key card.</p>

<p>“Presidential Suite, I assume?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. But president of Micronesia, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for saving me back there.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for making me an icon of cool.”</p>

<p>Julia laughed.</p>

<p>“Wanna grab a drink?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Really? A drink drink?”</p>

<p>“An imbibable relaxant. Yes.”</p>

<p>“I should check in with Jacob’s parents. They’ve got Benjy for
the weekend.”</p>

<p>“Cute.”</p>

<p>“Until he comes back a latency-phased Meir Kahane.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“He was a deranged right-wing—”</p>

<p>“You need need a drink drink.”</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, there was nothing logistical to go over, no
small talk to indulge in, only the inching shadow of their conversation at the
bespoke hardware gallery, and all that Julia knew but wouldn’t share.</p>

<p>“Go make your call.”</p>

<p>“It will only be five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, it is. Text me when you’re ready and I’ll meet
you at the bar. We have plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t too early for a drink?”</p>

<p>“In the millennium?”</p>

<p>“In the day.”</p>

<p>“In your life?”</p>

<p>“In the day, Mark. You’re already drunk on your bachelorhood.”</p>

<p>“A drunk person wouldn’t point out that a bachelor is someone
who has never been married.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re drunk on your freedom.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you mean aloneness?”</p>

<p>“I was imagining what you might say.”</p>

<p>“I’m drunk on my new sobriety.”</p>

<p>She thought of herself as being unusually astute about the
motivations of others, but she couldn’t parse what he was doing. Flirting with
someone he desired? Bolstering someone he felt sorry for? Innocently bantering?
And what was she doing? Any guilt she might have felt about flirting was now so
far beyond the horizon it might well have been right behind her. If anything,
she wished Jacob were there to watch.</p>

<p>They used to have their own secret lines of communication, ways
of smuggling messages: spelling in front of the young children; whispering in
front of Isaac; writing notes to each other about a phone conversation in
progress; hand and facial gestures organically developed over years, like when,
in Rabbi Singer’s office, Julia pressed two fingers to her brow and gently
shook her head while flaring her nostrils, which meant: Let it go. They could
find a way of reaching each other around any obstacle. But they needed the
obstacle.</p>

<p>Her mind leaped: Jacob had forced Sam to listen to a podcast
about messenger birds in World War I, and it captured Sam’s imagination—he
asked for a homing pigeon for his eleventh birthday. Delighting in the originality
of the request and, as always, wanting not only to go to any length to provide
for her children, but also to be seen as having gone to any length to provide
for her children, she took him seriously.</p>

<p>“They make wonderful indoor pets,” he promised. “There’s a—”</p>

<p>“Indoor?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. They need a big cage, but—”</p>

<p>“What about Argus?”</p>

<p>“With a little conditioning—”</p>

<p>“Great word.”</p>

<p>“Mom. With a little conditioning, they can totally be friends.
And once—”</p>

<p>“What about pooping?”</p>

<p>“They wear pigeon pants. Basically a diaper. You change it every
three hours.”</p>

<p>“No burden there.”</p>

<p>“I would do it.”</p>

<p>“Your school day is longer than three hours.”</p>

<p>“Mom, it would be so fun,” he said, shaking his fists in the way
that once inspired Jacob to wonder if he might have a sprinkle of Asperger’s.
“We could take it to the park, or to school, or Omi and Opi’s, or wherever,
attach a message to its collar, and it would just fly home.”</p>

<p>“Can I ask what’s fun about that?”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“In your own words.”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t obvious, I don’t know how to explain it.”</p>

<p>“And is it difficult to train them?”</p>

<p>“It’s super easy. You basically just give them a great home, and
they’ll want to come back.”</p>

<p>“What makes a home great?”</p>

<p>“It’s spacious, in direct sunlight, and the chicken wire
enclosing it is too tightly meshed for his head to fit through and get stuck.”</p>

<p>“That does sound nice.”</p>

<p>“And the bottom is lined with grassy sod, which is changed
regularly. And he has a bath, which is cleaned regularly.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“And lots of tasty treats, like endive, berries, buckwheat,
flax, mung bean sprouts, vetch.”</p>

<p>“Vetch?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I read it.”</p>

<p>“How spacious a cage are we talking about?”</p>

<p>“Really great would be six by nine.”</p>

<p>“Six by nine what?”</p>

<p>“Feet. Six-foot width and length, nine-foot height.”</p>

<p>“And where would we put such a spacious cage?”</p>

<p>“In my room.”</p>

<p>“We’d have to raise the ceiling.”</p>

<p>“Is that something we could do?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“So it could be a bit less tall and still OK.”</p>

<p>“And what if it doesn’t like its home?”</p>

<p>“It will.”</p>

<p>“But what if it doesn’t?”</p>

<p>“Mom, it will, because I’m going to do all of the things you’re
supposed to do to create a great home that it loves.”</p>

<p>“I’m just asking what if.”</p>

<p>“Mom.”</p>

<p>“I can’t ask a question?”</p>

<p>“I guess it doesn’t come back. OK? It goes and keeps going.”</p>

<p>It took only a week for Sam to forget that there were such
things as homing pigeons in the world—he learned that there were such things as
Nerf guns in the world—but Julia never forgot what he said: It goes and keeps
going.</p>

<p>“Why not,” she said to Mark, wishing there were a nearby surface
to rap her knuckles against. “Let’s have a drink drink.”</p>

<p>“Only one?”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” she said, preening the underside of her wing
before a flight that would reveal the comfort of her cage. “It’s probably too
late for that.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>SOMEONE ELSE’S OTHER LIFE</h2>

<p>It had been more than eight hours since they’d driven home in
silence from the vet’s office, four hundred ninety minutes of avoiding each
other in the house. There were ingredients, but there was no will, so Jacob
microwaved burritos. He arranged a dozen baby carrots that had no chance of
being eaten, and a heaping dollop of hummus so Julia could see the amount
missing from the container when she returned. He brought the food up to Max’s
room, knocked, and entered.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say come in.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t asking for permission. Just giving you time to take
your finger out of your nose.”</p>

<p>Max put his finger into his nose. Jacob put the plate on the
desk.</p>

<p>“Wat’cha doin’?”</p>

<p>“I’cha not doin’ nothin’,” Max said, turning the iPad facedown.</p>

<p>“Seriously, what?”</p>

<p>“Seriously, nothing.”</p>

<p>“What, dirty movies? Buying stuff on my credit card?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Looking up home euthanasia recipes?”</p>

<p>“Not at all funny.”</p>

<p>“Then what?”</p>

<p>“Other Life.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you played that.”</p>

<p>“No one plays it.”</p>

<p>“Right. I didn’t know you did it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, really. Sam won’t let me.”</p>

<p>“But the cat’s away.”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“I won’t rat you out.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>“Get it? Cat’s away? Rat you out?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“What’s the deal with that, anyway? It’s a game?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a game.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“It’s a community.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that,” Jacob said, unable to resist
using his most belittling voice.</p>

<p>“No,” Max said, “you don’t.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it more—to my understanding, anyway—more like a bunch
of people who pay a monthly membership to gather and explore an, I don’t know,
imagined landscape together?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not like synagogue.”</p>

<p>“Well played.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the food. See ya.”</p>

<p>“Whatever it is,” Jacob said, trying again, “it looks cool. From
what I’ve been able to see. From a distance.”</p>

<p>Max plugged his speech orifice with a burrito.</p>

<p>“Really,” Jacob said, sidling up. “I’m curious. I know Sam
plays—I mean, does—this all the time, and I want to see what it’s all about.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Try me.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t understand.”</p>

<p>“You realize I won a National Jewish Book Award at the age of
twenty-four?”</p>

<p>Max turned the iPad faceup, swiped it bright, and said, “I’m
currently recruiting work valences for a resonance promotion. Then I can barter
for some psychic upholstery and—”</p>

<p>“Psychic upholstery?”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the winner of an actual National Book Award would
need to ask.”</p>

<p>“And that’s you?” Jacob asked, touching an elflike creature.</p>

<p>“No. And don’t touch the screen.”</p>

<p>“Which one is you?”</p>

<p>“None of them is me.”</p>

<p>“Which one is Sam?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Which is Sam’s person?”</p>

<p>“His avatar?”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“There. By the vending machine.”</p>

<p>“What? The tan girl?”</p>

<p>“She’s a Latina.”</p>

<p>“Why is Sam a Latina?”</p>

<p>“Why are you a white man?”</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t have a choice.”</p>

<p>“Well, he did.”</p>

<p>“Can I take her for a spin?”</p>

<p>Max hated the feeling of his father’s hand on his shoulder. It
was repulsive to him—an experience somewhere near the middle of the spectrum
whose opposing poles were runny eggs and thirty thousand people demanding
gratification when the Nationals Park Kiss Cam imprisoned his mom and him in
the Jumbotron.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, shaking his shoulder free, “you can’t.”</p>

<p>“What’s the worst that could happen?”</p>

<p>“You could kill her.”</p>

<p>“Obviously I won’t. But even if I did, which I won’t, can’t you
just put in some more quarters and continue?”</p>

<p>“It took Sam four months to develop her skill set, bounty of
armaments, and psychic resources.”</p>

<p>“It’s taken me forty-two years.”</p>

<p>“Which is why you shouldn’t let anyone take your controls.”</p>

<p>“Maxy…”</p>

<p>“Max is fine.”</p>

<p>“Max. He who gave you life is begging you.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I command you to let me partake in Sam’s community.”</p>

<p>Max let out a deep, dramatic sigh.</p>

<p>“Two minutes,” he said. “And only aimless wandering.”</p>

<p>“Aimless Wandering is my middle name.”</p>

<p>With great reluctance, Max handed Jacob the iPad.</p>

<p>“To move, just slide your thumb in the direction you want to go.
To pick something up—”</p>

<p>“My thumb is the squat one on the end, right?”</p>

<p>Max didn’t respond.</p>

<p>“I’cha kidding, dude.”</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes on the road.”</p>

<p>When Jacob was a kid, games had one button. They were simple,
and fun, and no one felt that they were in any way lacking. No one felt a need
to crouch, to pivot, to switch weapons. You had a gun, you shot the bastards,
you high-fived your friends. Jacob didn’t want all these options—the more
control available, the less control he felt.</p>

<p>“You kinda suck at this,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s this game that kinda sucks.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a game, and it made more money in one day than every
book published in America that entire year combined.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that isn’t true.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it is, because there was an article about it.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“The Arts section.”</p>

<p>“The Arts section? Since when do you read the Arts section, and
since when were video games art?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a game.”</p>

<p>“And even if it did make all that money,” Jacob said, sliding
his feet into the stirrups of his high horse, “so what? What is that even a
measure of?”</p>

<p>“How much money it made.”</p>

<p>“Which is a measure of what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, how important it is?”</p>

<p>“There’s a difference, I’m sure you realize, between prevalence
and importance.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you realize that I don’t even know what prevalence means.”</p>

<p>“Kanye West is not more culturally important than—”</p>

<p>“Yes he is.”</p>

<p>“—than Philip Roth.”</p>

<p>“First of all, I’ve never even heard of that person. Second,
Kanye might not be valuable to you, but he’s definitely more important to the
world.”</p>

<p>Jacob remembered the period when Max was obsessed with relative
values—Would you rather have a handful of diamonds or a houseful of silver? For
a moment, which disappeared as it emerged, he saw the smaller Max.</p>

<p>“I guess we look at things differently,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Max said. “I look at things correctly. You
don’t. That’s a difference. How many people watch your TV show every week?”</p>

<p>“It’s not my show.”</p>

<p>“The show that you write for.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a simple question. There’s people who watch it when
it’s first on, then people who watch other showings, and DVR—”</p>

<p>“A few million?”</p>

<p>“Four.”</p>

<p>“Seventy million people play this game. And they had to buy it,
not just turn on the TV when they didn’t feel like spending time with their
kids or making out with their wives.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Basically eleven.”</p>

<p>“When I was your age—”</p>

<p>Max pointed at the screen.</p>

<p>“Pay attention to what you’re doing, Dad.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am.”</p>

<p>“Just don’t—”</p>

<p>“Under control.”</p>

<p>“Dad—”</p>

<p>“Yeah, yeah, yeahs,” he said, then turned his attention from the
iPad to Max. “They’re a band.”</p>

<p>“Dad!”</p>

<p>“You really inherited Mom’s talent for worrying.”</p>

<p>And then there was a sound Jacob had never heard before—a cross
between a screeching tire and the dying animal it just ran over.</p>

<p>“Oh shit!” Max screamed.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Oh shit!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, is that blood mine?”</p>

<p>“It’s Sam’s! You killed him!”</p>

<p>“No I didn’t. I just smelled some flowers.”</p>

<p>“You just inhaled a Bouquet of Fatality!”</p>

<p>“Why would there be a bouquet of fatality?”</p>

<p>“So assholes have a stupid way to die!”</p>

<p>“Easy, Max. It was an honest mistake.”</p>

<p>“Who cares if it was honest!”</p>

<p>“And with all due respect—”</p>

<p>“Oh shit, shit, shit!”</p>

<p>“—it’s a game.”</p>

<p>Jacob shouldn’t have said that. Clearly he shouldn’t have.</p>

<p>“With all due respect,” Max said with scary composure, “fuck
you.”</p>

<p>“What did you just say?”</p>

<p>“I said”—Max was unable to look his father in the eye, but he
had no trouble repeating himself—“fuck you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever speak to me like that.”</p>

<p>“Too bad I didn’t inherit Mom’s talent for eating shit.”</p>

<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t sound like nothing.”</p>

<p>“Nothing, OK?”</p>

<p>“No, not OK. Mom does a lot of things, and eating shit is not
one of them. And yes, I know you weren’t speaking literally.”</p>

<p>Had Max also heard them fighting? The broken glass? Or was he
merely fishing, seeing what kind of response he might get? What kind of
response did he want? And what was Jacob prepared to give?</p>

<p>Jacob stamped to the door, then turned back and said, “When
you’re ready to apologize, I’ll be—”</p>

<p>“I’m dead,” Max said. “The dead don’t apologize.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t dead, Max. There are actual dead people in the
world, and you aren’t one of them. You are upset. Upset and dead are different
states.”</p>

<p>The phone rang—a reprieve. Jacob was expecting it to be Julia;
when away, she always checked in before the kids went to bed.</p>

<p>“Hello?”</p>

<p>“Hi.”</p>

<p>“Benjy?”</p>

<p>“Hey, Dad.”</p>

<p>“Is everything OK?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“It’s late.”</p>

<p>“I’m in my pj’s.”</p>

<p>“Do you need anything, buddy?”</p>

<p>“No. Do you?”</p>

<p>“I’m fine.”</p>

<p>“You just wanted to say hi before bed?”</p>

<p>“You called me.”</p>

<p>“Actually, I wanted to talk to Max.”</p>

<p>“Now? On the phone?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Benjy wants to talk to you,” Jacob said, handing the phone to
Max.</p>

<p>“Could we have a little privacy?” Max asked.</p>

<p>The absurdity of it, the agony and beauty of it, almost brought
Jacob to his knees: these two independent consciousnesses, neither of which
existed ten and a half years ago, and existed only because of him, could now
not only operate free of him (that much he’d known for a long time), but demand
freedom.</p>

<p>Jacob picked up the iPad and left his offspring to talk. While
he fiddled, he accidentally maximized the window behind Other Life. It was a
discussion board, with the heading “Can You Humanely Euthanize a Dog at Home?”
The first comment his eyes fell upon read: “I had the same problem, but with a
grown dog. It’s so sad. My mum took Charlie to our friend, a farmer down the
way, who said he would be able to shoot him. It was much easier for us. He took
him for a walk, talked to him, and shot him while they were walking.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE ARTIFICIAL EMERGENCY</h2>

<p>Instead of calling to check on Benjy, who was obviously fine,
Julia fussed with her hair, sucked in her cheeks, tugged down her shirt,
scrutinized her makeup, pressed her belly, squinted. She texted Mark, if only
to create a hard stop to her self-loathing: confirmed kid is alive. ready
whenever. By the time she got to the hotel bar, he was already at a table.</p>

<p>“Spacious accommodations?” he asked as she took the seat across
from him.</p>

<p>“A room of my own? An oven would feel spacious.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like you were born seventy-five years too late.” And
then, with a faux wince: “Too soon?”</p>

<p>“Let’s see, my father-in-law would say it’s absolutely fine, so
long as the person making the joke doesn’t have a cell of goyish blood. Then
Jacob would disagree. Then they’d switch positions and fight with twice the
energy.”</p>

<p>The waiter approached.</p>

<p>“A couple of glasses of white?” Mark suggested.</p>

<p>“Sounds great,” Julia said. “Are you going to have one, too?”</p>

<p>Mark laughed and held up two fingers.</p>

<p>“How is Irv? Seems like he’s stirred up a lot of shit.”</p>

<p>“He’s a human plunger. But it beats being ignored.”</p>

<p>“Being universally reviled?”</p>

<p>“Talking about him is exactly what he’d want us to be doing
right now. Let’s not give him the satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Moving along.”</p>

<p>“So how’s it going?”</p>

<p>“What? The divorce?”</p>

<p>“The divorce, your rediscovered interior monologue, the whole
thing.”</p>

<p>“It’s a process.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that how Cheney described torture?”</p>

<p>“You know that old joke: ‘Why are divorces so expensive?’”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because they’re worth it.”</p>

<p>“I thought that’s what they said about chemo.”</p>

<p>“Well, both make you bald,” he said, holding back his hair.</p>

<p>“You aren’t bald.”</p>

<p>“Please, God, not distinguished.”</p>

<p>“Not even distinguished.”</p>

<p>“Just taller than my hair.”</p>

<p>“You’re all the same: endlessly experimenting with facial hair
configurations, obsessed with thinning hair where there isn’t any. And yet
indifferent to the paunch spilling over your belt.”</p>

<p>“I am a very bald man. But that’s not the point. The point is,
divorce is profoundly expensive—emotionally, logistically, financially—and it’s
worth it. But just.”</p>

<p>“Just?”</p>

<p>“It’s no landslide. It just barely ekes it out.”</p>

<p>“But you eke it out with your life, right?”</p>

<p>“Better to get out of the building with burns over ninety
percent of your body than perish inside. But best to have left before the
fire.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but it’s cold outside.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your burning house? Nunavut?”</p>

<p>“I always imagine house fires in winter.”</p>

<p>“And you?” Mark asked. “What’s the news on Newark Street?”</p>

<p>“You’re not the only one in a process.”</p>

<p>“What’s going on?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she said, unfolding the napkin.</p>

<p>“Nunavut?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be sharing none of it?”</p>

<p>“It’s truly nothing,” she said, refolding it.</p>

<p>“So, fine.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t talk about it.”</p>

<p>“You probably shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“But even though we haven’t started drinking, I’ve got a
psychosomatic buzz.”</p>

<p>“This is going to be a bomb, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I can trust you, right?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it depends.”</p>

<p>“Seriously?”</p>

<p>“Only a trustworthy person would admit to his unreliability.”</p>

<p>“Forget it.”</p>

<p>“I cheated on my taxes last year, OK? Badly. I deducted an
office I don’t even have. Now you can blackmail me, if it comes to that.”</p>

<p>“Why would you cheat on your taxes?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s an honor to contribute to our functioning society,
but only to a point. Because I’m a schmuck. Because my accountant is a schmuck
and told me I could. I don’t know why.”</p>

<p>“The other day I was at home and heard a buzzing. There was a
cell phone on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Oh shit.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“There is not a single story about a cell phone that ends well.”</p>

<p>“I opened it up and there were some pretty sexually explicit
messages.”</p>

<p>“Texts, or images?”</p>

<p>“Does it make a difference?”</p>

<p>“An image is what it is. A text could be anything.”</p>

<p>“Licking cum out of assholes. That kind of stuff.”</p>

<p>“Image?”</p>

<p>“Words,” Julia said. “But if you ask for the context, I’m going
to call the IRS.”</p>

<p>The drinks arrived, and the waitress scurried off. Julia
wondered how much, if anything, she had heard, what she might tell the hostess,
what young, unencumbered women might have a laugh that night at the expense of
the Bloch family.</p>

<p>“I confronted Jacob about it, and he said it was just talk. Just
some seriously overheated flirting.”</p>

<p>“Overheated? Licking cum out of assholes is Dresden.”</p>

<p>“It’s not good.”</p>

<p>“And who was at the other end of them?”</p>

<p>“A director he works with.”</p>

<p>“Not Scorsese…”</p>

<p>“That’s too soon.”</p>

<p>“Seriously, Julia, I am so very sorry to hear this. And
shocked.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s for the best. Like you said, the door has to open to
light up the dark room.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Do you believe him?”</p>

<p>“In what sense?”</p>

<p>“That it was just words.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“And does the distinction matter to you?”</p>

<p>“Between talking and doing? Sure it matters.”</p>

<p>“How much does it matter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“He cheated on you, Julia.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t cheat on me.”</p>

<p>“Too big a word for having had sex with another woman?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t have sex with another woman.”</p>

<p>“Of course he did. And even if he didn’t, he did. And you know
it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not excusing, or minimizing, what he did. But there’s a
difference.”</p>

<p>“Writing to another woman like that is a betrayal, no hairs to
split. I’m sorry, but I can’t sit here and allow you to think you don’t deserve
better.”</p>

<p>“It was only words.”</p>

<p>“And if you’d written those ‘only words’? How do you think he’d
have reacted?”</p>

<p>“If he knew that we were having this drink, he’d have a grand
mal seizure.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because that’s how insecure he is.”</p>

<p>“In a marriage with three children?”</p>

<p>“He’s the fourth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get it.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“If he were only pathologically insecure, OK. He is who he is.
And if he’d only cheated, I suppose I can see the way back from that. But the
combination? How can you accept it?”</p>

<p>“Because of the boys. Because I’m forty-three years old. Because
I have almost twenty years of history with him, almost all of which is good
history. Because regardless of the stupidity or evil of his mistake, he’s a
fundamentally good person. He is. Because I’ve never sexted with anyone, but
I’ve done my share of flirting and fantasizing. Because I often haven’t been a
good wife, often on purpose. Because I’m weak.”</p>

<p>“Only the weakness is persuasive.”</p>

<p>A thought walked in, a memory: checking the boys for ticks on
the porch of the rental in Connecticut. They passed the kids back and
forth—looking in armpits, through the hair, between toes—she and Jacob
double-checking each other’s work, always finding ticks the other missed. She
was good at removing them in their entirety, and he was good at distracting the
boys with funny impressions of their mother shopping in the supermarket. Why
that memory right then?</p>

<p>“What do you fantasize about?” Mark asked.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You said you’ve done your share of fantasizing. About what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, taking a drink. “I was just talking.”</p>

<p>“I know. And I’m just asking. What do you fantasize about?”</p>

<p>“That’s not of your business.”</p>

<p>“Not of my business?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Drunk on your weakness?”</p>

<p>“I don’t find you cute.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“Or charming. Despite all of the effort.”</p>

<p>“It’s effortless to be this charmless.”</p>

<p>“Or sexy.”</p>

<p>Mark took a long drink, draining the remaining half of his
glass, then said, “Leave him.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to leave him.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because marriage is the thing you don’t give up on.”</p>

<p>“No, life is.”</p>

<p>“And because I’m not you.”</p>

<p>“No, but you’re you.”</p>

<p>“There is not a part of me that wishes I were alone.”</p>

<p>But as the words entered the world, she knew they were false.
She thought about her one-bedroom dream homes, the subconscious blueprints for
her departure. They predated the sexting, by years.</p>

<p>“And I’m not going to destroy my family,” she added, at once a
non sequitur and the logical conclusion to the line of thought.</p>

<p>“By fixing your family?”</p>

<p>“By ending it.”</p>

<p>Just then, at the best, or worst, possible moment, Billie came
running up, giddy or asthmatic.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to interrupt—”</p>

<p>“Is everything OK?”</p>

<p>“Micronesia has a n—”</p>

<p>“Slow down.”</p>

<p>“Micronesia has a nu—”</p>

<p>“Breathe.”</p>

<p>She reached for one of the glasses and took a gulp.</p>

<p>“That’s not water,” she said, her hand to her chest.</p>

<p>“It’s chardonnay.”</p>

<p>“I just broke the law.”</p>

<p>“We’ll testify to your character,” Mark said.</p>

<p>“Micronesia has a nuclear weapon!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Last year Russia invaded Mongolia. The year before was bird
flu. Usually they wait until the second afternoon, but. We have a nuke! Isn’t
that cool! So lucky!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean we have a nuke?” Mark asked.</p>

<p>“We need to convene the delegation.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Pay for your drinks and keep up with me.”</p>

<p>Mark put some cash on the table and the three race-walked toward
the elevators.</p>

<p>“The program facilitators released a statement that a weapons
dealer was caught attempting to smuggle an armed suitcase bomb through Yap
Airport.”</p>

<p>“Yap Airport?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I don’t know, that’s what it’s called.”</p>

<p>“Why through Micronesia?” Mark asked.</p>

<p>“Precisely,” Billie said, although not one of the three knew
even approximately what that meant. “We’ve already started to get offers from
Pakistan, Iran, and, weirdly, Luxembourg.”</p>

<p>“Offers?” Mark asked.</p>

<p>“They want us to sell them the bomb.” And then, to Julia: “You
understand, right?”</p>

<p>Julia gave an uncertain nod.</p>

<p>“So explain it to him later. It’s a whole new ball game!”</p>

<p>“Let’s round up the kids,” Julia said to Mark.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the ones on eleven, you get the ones on twelve. Meet
in your room?”</p>

<p>“Why mine?”</p>

<p>“Fine, mine.”</p>

<p>“No, mine is fine, I just—”</p>

<p>“Mark’s room,” Billie said.</p>

<p>Mark got on the elevator. Billie held Julia back for a moment.</p>

<p>“Is everything OK?” Billie asked when the elevator doors closed.</p>

<p>“It’s confusing to have a nuclear weapon.”</p>

<p>“I meant you.”</p>

<p>“What about me?”</p>

<p>“Are you OK?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“You look like you’re about to cry.”</p>

<p>“Me? No.”</p>

<p>“Oh, OK.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am?”</p>

<p>But maybe she was. Maybe the artificial emergency released
trapped feelings about the real emergency. There was a trauma center in her
brain—she had no Dr. Silvers to explain that to her, but she had the Internet.
The most unexpected situations would set it off, and then all thoughts and
perception rushed toward it. At the center was Sam’s injury. And at the center
of that—the vortex into which all thoughts and perceptions were pulled—was the
moment when Jacob carried him into the house, saying, “Something happened,” and
she saw more blood than there was but couldn’t hear Sam’s screaming, and for a
moment, no longer than a moment, she lost control. For a moment she was
untethered from rationality, from reality, from herself. The soul departs the
body at the moment of death, but there is a yet more complete abandoning: everything
departed her body at the moment she saw her child’s flowing blood.</p>

<p>Jacob looked at her, sternly, hard-hearted, godlike, and made
each word a sentence: “Get. Yourself. Together. Now.” The sum of everything she
hated him for would never surpass her love for him in that moment.</p>

<p>He put Sam in her arms and said, “We’ll call Dr. Kaisen on the
way to the emergency room.”</p>

<p>Sam looked at Julia with a prehuman terror and screamed, “Why
did that happen? Why did that happen?” And pleaded, “It’s funny. It’s funny, right?”</p>

<p>She gripped Sam’s eyes with her eyes, held them hard, and didn’t
say, “It will be OK,” and didn’t say nothing. She said, “I love you, and I’m
here.”</p>

<p>The sum of everything she hated herself for would never surpass
her knowledge that in the most important moment of her child’s life, she’d been
a good mother.</p>

<p>And then, as quickly as it had seized control, Julia’s trauma
center relented. Maybe it was tired. Maybe it was merciful. Maybe she had
looked away and looked back, and remembered that she was in the world. But how
had the last thirty minutes passed? Had she taken the elevator or the stairs?
Had she knocked on the door of Mark’s room or was it open?</p>

<p>The debate was under way and roiling. Did anyone notice her
absence? Her presence?</p>

<p>“A stolen nuclear weapon is not an occasion for bartering,”
Billie said. “We want this thing disarmed, pronto, period.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t steal it. But I totally agree with what you just
said.”</p>

<p>“We should just bury it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we turn it into energy somehow?”</p>

<p>“We should give it to the Israelis,” said a boy in a yarmulke.</p>

<p>“Screw that, let’s bury it in Israel.”</p>

<p>“If I can butt in for just a moment,” Mark said. “My role here
isn’t to suggest conclusions but to help you ask provocative questions, so try
this one on for size: Is it possible that there’s an important option we
haven’t yet entertained? What if we kept the bomb?”</p>

<p>“Kept the bomb?” Julia said, making her presence unignorable.
“No, we can’t keep the bomb.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Mark asked.</p>

<p>“Because we’re responsible people.”</p>

<p>“Let’s just play this out.”</p>

<p>“Play is not the right word for a discussion about a nuclear
bomb.”</p>

<p>“Let him talk,” Sam said.</p>

<p>Mark talked: “Maybe this is a chance to finally control our
destiny? For most of our history, we’ve been at the mercy of others: overrun by
the Portuguese and Spanish trading goliaths, sold to Germany, conquered by
Japan and the United States…”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose anyone brought an extremely small violin?”
Julia said to the kids. Nobody understood the joke.</p>

<p>Mark lowered his volume, asserting calm: “I’m just saying, we
have never been fully self-reliant.”</p>

<p>“There hasn’t been a fully self-reliant country in the history
of the world,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Oh, you just got served,” a boy said to Mark.</p>

<p>“Iceland is fully self-reliant,” Mark said.</p>

<p>“Oh, you just got served!” the same boy said to Julia.</p>

<p>“No one’s getting served,” Mark said. “We’re thinking our way
through a very complicated issue.”</p>

<p>“Iceland is a Hooverville,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Look,” Mark said, “if I’m being an idiot, the only thing my
blathering will have cost us is three minutes.”</p>

<p>“I just got a text from Liechtenstein,” Billie said, holding her
phone as if it were the torch and she were the Statue of Liberty. “They’re
offering us a deal.”</p>

<p>“Now, clearly we have no nuclear program of any kind—”</p>

<p>“Liechtenstein is a country?”</p>

<p>“—and wouldn’t have the means or motives to acquire a nuclear
weapon on the black market.”</p>

<p>“Jamaica wants in,” Billie said, holding up another text.
“They’re offering three hundred billion dollars.”</p>

<p>“They know we’re talking about a bomb, right? Not a nuclear
bong? Can I get a hallelujah!”</p>

<p>“Xenophobic,” someone muttered.</p>

<p>“And yet,” Mark went on, “we suddenly find ourselves nuclear,
with the ability, should we choose to exercise it, of entering the league of
functionally autonomous nations, nations capable of dictating their own terms,
nations that aren’t subservient to other nations, or to the predicaments of
their histories.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Julia said, her famous composure now in witness
protection. “So we have some gripes, so life hasn’t been a trip to Epcot, and
hey hey, as it turns out, we just click our uranium heels and boom, life’s
bouncer lets us into the greatest of all parties.”</p>

<p>“That’s not what he was suggesting,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“He’s an unclear suggester.” And then, turning to Mark: “You’re
an un-cle-ar bomb, that’s what you are.”</p>

<p>“I was trying to suggest that we explore, if only to dismiss,
the potential upsides of having a bomb.”</p>

<p>“Let’s bomb someone!” someone said.</p>

<p>“Let’s!” Julia echoed. “Who? Or does it even matter?”</p>

<p>“Of course it matters,” Billie said, puzzled and upset by
Julia’s behavior.</p>

<p>“Mexico?” a girl asked.</p>

<p>“Iran, obviously,” Yarmulke Boy said.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Julia said, “we should bomb some war-torn,
famine-ravaged African country where orphans are so skinny they’re fat?”</p>

<p>That killed the buzz.</p>

<p>“Why would we do that?” Billie asked.</p>

<p>“Because we can,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Jesus, Mom.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ‘Jesus, Mom’ me.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to bomb anyone,” Mark said.</p>

<p>“But you see, we are,” Julia said. “That’s how the story always
ends. You’re either a country that never bombs, or you’re a country that is
open to bombing. And once you make yourself open to bombing, you will bomb.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any sense, Julia.”</p>

<p>“Only because you’re a man, Mark.”</p>

<p>The kids looked at one another. A few giggled nervously, Sam not
among them.</p>

<p>“OK,” Mark said, calling and raising Julia, “so here’s another
idea: let’s bomb ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Billie asked, confused to the point of anguish.</p>

<p>“Because Julia—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bloch.”</p>

<p>“—would rather die than save her life. So why draw it out?”</p>

<p>“See what you did?” Sam said to his mother.</p>

<p>“Jamaica went up to four hundred billion,” Billie said, holding
up her phone.</p>

<p>Someone said: “Yah, mon.”</p>

<p>Someone said: “Jamaica doesn’t have four hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>Someone said: “We should be asking for real money. The kind we
can take home and buy real stuff with.”</p>

<p>Sam pulled his mother into the hallway by her wrist, as she’d
many times pulled him.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” he said.</p>

<p>“What am I doing?”</p>

<p>“I told Dad I didn’t want you to come on this trip, and you made
a big deal when I said don’t make a big deal, and you’re more worried about
coming off as a cool mom than actually being a good mom.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“You make everything about you. Everything is always you.”</p>

<p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about, and neither do you.”</p>

<p>“You’re making me apologize for words I didn’t write, so I can
have a bar mitzvah that only you want me to have. You not only check my online
search history, you try to hide the fact that you don’t trust me. And do you
think I think the pencils on my desk sharpen themselves?”</p>

<p>“I take care of you, Sam. Believe me, it brings me no pleasure
to be shamed in front of the rabbi, or to organize your pigsty desk.”</p>

<p>“You’re a nag. And it does bring you pleasure. The only thing
that makes you happy is controlling every last tiny detail of our lives,
because you have no control over your own.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you learn that word?”</p>

<p>“What word?”</p>

<p>“Nag.”</p>

<p>“Everyone knows that word.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a kid word.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a kid.”</p>

<p>“You’re my kid.”</p>

<p>“It’s annoying enough when you treat your kids like kids, but
Dad—”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Sam.”</p>

<p>“He says you can’t help yourself, but I don’t see why that makes
any difference.”</p>

<p>“Be careful.”</p>

<p>“Or what? I’ll realize there’s Internet porn, or break a pencil
tip and die?”</p>

<p>“Stop now.”</p>

<p>“Or I’ll accidentally say something that everybody already
knows?”</p>

<p>“And what would that be?”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Mom.”</p>

<p>“What does everybody know?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know as much as you think you do.”</p>

<p>“That we’re all just scared of you. We’re unhappy because we
can’t live our lives, because you’re a nag and we’re scared of you.”</p>

<p>“We?”</p>

<p>Billie came into the hallway and approached Sam.</p>

<p>“Are you OK?”</p>

<p>“Go away, Billie.”</p>

<p>“What did I do?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t do anything,” Julia said.</p>

<p>Sam continued to lay into his mother, but now through Billie: “Will
you please just mind your own business for three consecutive seconds?”</p>

<p>“Did I say something?” she asked Julia.</p>

<p>“You aren’t wanted,” Sam told her. “Go away.”</p>

<p>“Sam?”</p>

<p>Tears brimming, Sam scurried off. Julia stayed there, an ice
sculpture of frozen tears.</p>

<p>“It’s kind of funny, right?” Billie said, her eyes overflowing
with the tears neither mother nor son could release.</p>

<p>Julia thought about her injured baby pleading, It’s funny. It’s
funny.</p>

<p>“What’s funny?”</p>

<p>“Babies kick you from the inside, and then they come out and
kick you some more.”</p>

<p>“It’s been my experience,” Julia said, her hand moving to her
belly.</p>

<p>“I read it in one of my parents’ parenting books.”</p>

<p>“Why on earth do you read those?”</p>

<p>“To try to understand them.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>SOMEONE ELSE’S OTHER DEATH</h2>

<p>Jacob went online and didn’t scan for breaking news in the
worlds of real estate porn, design porn, or porn, and didn’t scan for the good
fortune of people he envied and would have preferred dead, and didn’t spend a
soothing half hour in Bob Ross’s happy little womb. He found the tech support
number for Other Life. No great surprise, he had to navigate his way through an
automated service—a sedentary Theseus with only a phone cord.</p>

<p>“Other Life … iPad … I don’t know … I really don’t know … I
don’t know … Help … Help…”</p>

<p>After a few minutes of saying “I don’t know” and “Help” like an
alien impersonating a human, he was connected to someone with an almost
impenetrable accent who did everything possible to conceal the fact that he was
an Indian impersonating an American.</p>

<p>“Yes, hi, my name is Jacob Bloch and I’m calling on behalf of my
son. We had an accident with his avatar…”</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Bloch. I see that you are calling from
Washington, D.C. Are you enjoying the unseasonably nice weather this late
evening?”</p>

<p>“No.” Jacob had no patience to lose, but being asked to pretend
that the phone call wasn’t international found him some nastiness.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Bloch. Good evening. My name is John Williams.”</p>

<p>“No kidding! I loved what you did with Schindler’s List.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Jurassic World, not as much.”</p>

<p>“How can I assist you tonight?”</p>

<p>“As I said, there was an accident with my son’s avatar.”</p>

<p>“What kind of accident?”</p>

<p>“I accidentally sniffed a Bouquet of Fatalism.”</p>

<p>“Fatality?”</p>

<p>“Whatever. I sniffed it.”</p>

<p>“And can I ask why would you do that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Why does anyone want to smell anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but a Bouquet of Fatality offers instant death.”</p>

<p>“Right, no, I get that—I get that now. But I was new to the
game.”</p>

<p>“It is not a game.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Can we just fix this?”</p>

<p>“Were you trying to kill yourself, Mr. Bloch?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. And it’s not me. It’s my son.”</p>

<p>“Your son sniffed it?”</p>

<p>“I sniffed it on my son’s behalf.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there some kind of Other Life mulligan, or something?”</p>

<p>“Mulligan, sir?”</p>

<p>“Do-over.”</p>

<p>“If there were no consequences, it would only be a game.”</p>

<p>“I’m a writer, so I really do understand the gravity of
mortality, but—”</p>

<p>“You can reincarnate, but without any of your psychic
upholstery. So it will be as if you are beginning again.”</p>

<p>“So what do you suggest I do?”</p>

<p>“You could reacquire psychic upholstery on your son’s behalf.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know how to play.”</p>

<p>“It’s not play.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to do it.”</p>

<p>“Simply graze for low-hanging resilience fruit.”</p>

<p>“Graze what?”</p>

<p>“Apothecary vineyards.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t know how.”</p>

<p>“It’s extremely time-consuming, but not difficult.”</p>

<p>“How time-consuming are we talking about?”</p>

<p>“Assuming you became proficient fairly quickly, I would estimate
six months.”</p>

<p>“Only six months? Well, that’s fantastic news, because I was
sitting here worrying you were talking about something really time-consuming.
But this is great, because I don’t have time to get the manifest-destined mole
on my breast looked at, but I can certainly spend a thousand hours clamping
shut my carpal tunnels while committing brain cell genocide as I scour
apothecary vineyards for low-hanging resilience fruit, whatever the fuck that
means.”</p>

<p>“Or you could purchase a complete rebirth.”</p>

<p>“A what?”</p>

<p>“It is possible to revert your avatar’s profile to a designated
moment in time. In your case, to immediately before sniffing the Bouquet of
Fatality.”</p>

<p>“Why the hell didn’t you lead with that?”</p>

<p>“Some people find the option offensive.”</p>

<p>“Offensive?”</p>

<p>“Some believe that it undermines the spirit of Other Life.”</p>

<p>“Well, I doubt that many fathers in my position would feel that
way. This is something we can do right now? Over the phone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can process your payment and remotely initiate the
complete rebirth.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is just the best news I’ve heard … maybe ever. Thank
you. Thank you. And really, I’m sorry about being such an asshole earlier. A
lot is on the line here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand, Mr. Bloch.”</p>

<p>“Call me Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Jacob. I will have to obtain some information about
the avatar, and the reversion date and time. But to confirm, you are purchasing
the twelve-hundred-dollar complete rebirth.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, did you say twelve hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“As in: a one, followed by a two, followed by consecutive
zeroes, with no decimal?”</p>

<p>“Plus tax. Yes.”</p>

<p>“How much did the game cost?”</p>

<p>“It is not a game.”</p>

<p>“Cut the shit, Williams.”</p>

<p>“Other Life is free.”</p>

<p>“Is this some kind of joke? Twelve hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>“It is not a joke, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“You realize we live in a world with starving children and cleft
palates, right?”</p>

<p>“I do realize that.”</p>

<p>“And you still think it’s ethical to charge twelve hundred
dollars to correct an accident in a video game?”</p>

<p>“It is not a game, sir.”</p>

<p>“Giving twelve hundred to you requires me making twenty-four
hundred. You know this, right?”</p>

<p>“I do not set the prices, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is anyone not the messenger?”</p>

<p>“Would you like to process a complete rebirth, or has the price
made this option unappealing?”</p>

<p>“Unappealing? Leukemia is unappealing. This is fucking criminal.
And you should be ashamed.”</p>

<p>“I take it that you no longer want to purchase a complete
rebirth.”</p>

<p>“Take it as a class-action suit I’m going to bring against your
depraved company. I know people that your people should be very afraid of. I
know serious lawyers who would do this for me as a favor. And I’m going to
write about this for The Washington Post—Style section, or maybe Outlook—and
they’ll publish it, you’ll see, and then you’ll be sorry. You have fucked with
the wrong guy!”</p>

<p>Jacob smelled Argus shit, but then he often smelled Argus shit
when raging.</p>

<p>“Before ending this call, Jacob, would you say that I have
responded to your needs in a satisfactory manner?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bloch hung up the phone, then growled, “Fuck my needs.”</p>

<p>He took a breath that he hated, picked the phone back up, but
didn’t dial any number.</p>

<p>“Help…,” he said to no one. “Help…”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A COMPLETE REBIRTH</h2>

<p>Julia was sitting on the edge of her bed. The TV was set to an
advertisement for the hotel in which she was already captive. The lithograph on
the wall was in an edition of five thousand—five thousand perfectly identical,
perfectly unique, utterly corny snowflakes. She started to dial Jacob. She
considered looking for Sam. There were always too many things to do when she
had no time. But in need of a way to fill minutes, she never knew how.</p>

<p>The
wilderness was interrupted by a knock.</p>

<p>“Thank
you for opening the door,” Mark said when it was only cracked.</p>

<p>“The
peephole was smudgy,” Julia said, opening it farther.</p>

<p>“I
was out of line.”</p>

<p>“You
were off the map.”</p>

<p>“I’m
trying to apologize here.”</p>

<p>“You
found your interior monologue, and it told you you were being an asshole?”</p>

<p>“That’s
exactly what happened.”</p>

<p>“Well,
allow my exterior monologue to echo the sentiment.”</p>

<p>“Duly
noted.”</p>

<p>“Now
isn’t a good time.”</p>

<p>“I
know.”</p>

<p>“I
just had a terrible fight with Sam.”</p>

<p>“I
know.”</p>

<p>“You
know everything.”</p>

<p>“I
wasn’t lying when I told the kids I’m omniscient.”</p>

<p>Julia
rubbed her temple and turned, creating a space for Mark to enter.</p>

<p>“Whenever
Sam would cry as a baby, we’d say, ‘I know, I know,’ and give him his pacifier.
So he started calling it his ‘I-know.’ Your omniscience just reminded me of
that. I haven’t thought about it for years.” And with a disbelieving shake of
the head: “Was that even this life?”</p>

<p>“Same
life, different person.”</p>

<p>With
a voice like a window that knows it’s about to be broken, she said, “I’m a good
mother, Mark.”</p>

<p>“You
are. I know.”</p>

<p>“I’m
a really good mother. It’s not just that I try hard. I’m good.”</p>

<p>The
distance between them closed by a step, and Mark said, “You’re a good wife, and
good mother, and good friend.”</p>

<p>“I
try so hard.”</p>

<p>When
Jacob brought Argus home, Julia felt betrayed—she showed fury to Jacob, and
delight to the boys. And yet it was she who actually bothered to read a book on
dog training and care. Most of it was intuitively obvious, but one thing that
struck her was the advice that one shouldn’t say no to a dog, as it would
process the no as an existential assessment—a negation of the animal’s worth.
It would hear no as its name: “You are No.” Instead, you should make a little
clicking sound, or say, “Uh-uh,” or clap your hands. How anyone could know this
much about a dog’s mental life, or why it would be so much better to be named
“Uh-uh,” was beyond Julia, but something about it seemed plausible, even
significant.</p>

<p>Julia
needed an existential assessment of goodness. She needed to be renamed, to
hear: “You are Good.”</p>

<p>Mark
put his hand on her cheek.</p>

<p>She
took a half step back.</p>

<p>“What
are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I’m
sorry. Did that feel wrong?”</p>

<p>“Of
course it did. You know Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And
you know my kids.”</p>

<p>“I
do.”</p>

<p>“And
you know that I’m going through something very difficult. And you know that Sam
and I had a terrible fight.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And
your response is to try to kiss me?”</p>

<p>“I
didn’t try to kiss you.”</p>

<p>Could
she have misinterpreted? She couldn’t have. But neither could she prove that he
was trying to kiss her. Which made her feel small enough to go hide in the
closet by walking under its closed door.</p>

<p>“OK,
so what were you trying to do?”</p>

<p>“I
wasn’t trying to do anything. You obviously needed comforting, and reaching for
you felt natural.”</p>

<p>“Natural
to you.”</p>

<p>“I’m
sorry.”</p>

<p>“And
I don’t need comforting.”</p>

<p>“I
thought it would be welcomed. And everyone needs comforting.”</p>

<p>“You
thought touching my face would be welcomed?”</p>

<p>“I
did. The way you angled your body to suggest I enter the room. How you looked
at me. When you said, ‘I’m good,’ and took a step closer.”</p>

<p>Had
she done that? She remembered the moment, but felt certain that he had stepped
toward her.</p>

<p>“Boy,
was I asking for it.”</p>

<p>Was
it possible she’d been too hard on Jacob, simply because he’d been first to
express what she knew she’d been first to feel? There was no balance to be
found in cruelty—only in cheating on him, which she wasn’t going to do.</p>

<p>“I’m
not full of shit, Julia. You think I am—”</p>

<p>“I
do.”</p>

<p>“—but
I’m not. I’m sorry if I put you in an uncomfortable position. That’s not at all
what I had in mind.”</p>

<p>“You’re
lonely, and I look like a Band-Aid.”</p>

<p>“I’m
not lonely, and you don’t—”</p>

<p>“You’re
the one who needed comforting.”</p>

<p>“We
both did. We both do.”</p>

<p>“You
need to leave.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“So
why aren’t you going?”</p>

<p>“Because
I believe you don’t want me to go.”</p>

<p>“How
could I prove it?”</p>

<p>“You
could push me.”</p>

<p>“I’m
not going to push you, Mark.”</p>

<p>“Why
do you think you just used my name?”</p>

<p>“Because
it’s yours.”</p>

<p>“What
were you emphasizing? You didn’t use my name when telling me to go. Only when
telling me what you weren’t going to do.”</p>

<p>“Jesus.
Just go, Mark.”</p>

<p>“OK,”
he said, and turned for the door.</p>

<p>She
didn’t know what the emergency was, only that the trauma center of her brain
was consuming everything. At the margin, still safe, remained the strange joy
of finding and removing ticks in Connecticut. But the trauma smelled the
pleasure, and attacked it. At the end of every night, she sat in a dry bathtub
and checked herself, because if she didn’t, no one would.</p>

<p>“No,
wait,” Julia said. Mark turned back to face her. “I did need comforting.”</p>

<p>“Still,
I—”</p>

<p>“I’m
not finished. I did need comforting, and I’m sure I communicated as much, even
if I didn’t intend to, or realize it.”</p>

<p>“Thank
you for telling me that. And while we’re in the business of full disclosure: I
stepped toward you.”</p>

<p>“You
lied to me.”</p>

<p>“No,
I just couldn’t find a way to—”</p>

<p>“You
lied to me, and made me question myself.”</p>

<p>“I
couldn’t find a way—”</p>

<p>“I knew I was right.” She paused. A small memory displaced a
small laugh: “Kisses. I just remembered what Sam used to call kisses.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“He had a few different names for them, depending on the
situation. A ‘make-it-better’ was a kiss given in response to an injury. A
‘sheyna boychick’ was a kiss from his great-grandfather. A ‘that-face’ was from
his grandmother. A ‘you’ was one of those spontaneous,
I-need-to-kiss-you-right-now kisses. I guess we’d always say ‘You’ when going
in for one of those.”</p>

<p>“Kids are wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Before they know anything, they really are.”</p>

<p>Mark folded his arms and said, “So, here’s the thing, Julia—”</p>

<p>“Uh-oh, emphasis.”</p>

<p>“I was trying to kiss you.”</p>

<p>“You were?” She felt not only relieved of the earlier
embarrassment, but, for the first time in her selectively edited memory,
wanted.</p>

<p>“Truth be told.”</p>

<p>“Why were you trying to kiss me?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“To make-it-better me?”</p>

<p>“To you you.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve chosen not to close your eyes?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You see.”</p>

<p>She stepped toward him, open-eyed, and asked, “Are things about
to become bad?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>She took another half step toward him, and asked, “You promise?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>There was no more distance to cross.</p>

<p>She asked: “What can you promise?”</p>

<p>He promised: “Things are about to be different.”</p>

<h1>III. USES OF A JEWISH FIST</h1>

<h2>HOLDING A PEN, PUNCHING, SELF-LOVE</h2>

<p>“This is a joke?” Irv asked as they drove to Washington
National—the Blochs would sooner renounce air travel than refer to it as Reagan
National. NPR was on, because Irv sought confrontations with what he loathed,
and to his extreme revulsion there had been a balanced segment on new
settlement construction in the West Bank. Irv loathed NPR. It was not only the
wretched politics, but the flamboyantly precious, out-of-no-closet sissiness,
the wide-eyed wonder coming from the you-wouldn’t-hit-a-guy-with-glasses
voices. (And all of them—men, women, young and old—seem to share the same
voice, passing it from one throat to another as necessary.) The virtues of
“listener-supported radio” don’t alter the fact that no one with self-respect
uses the word satchel, much less an actual satchel, and anyway, how many
subscriptions to The New Yorker does a person need?</p>

<p>“Well, now I’ll have an answer,” Irv said, with a self-satisfied
nod that resembled davening or Parkinson’s.</p>

<p>“To what?” Jacob asked, unable to swim past the bait.</p>

<p>“When someone asks me what was the most factually erroneous,
morally repugnant, and also just boring radio segment I’ve ever heard.”</p>

<p>Irv’s knee-jerk response triggered a reflex in Jacob’s brain’s
knee, and within a few exchanges they were rhetorical Russian wedding
dancers—arms crossed, kicking at everything but anything.</p>

<p>“And anyway,” Jacob said, feeling that they’d taken things far
enough, “it was a self-described opinion piece.”</p>

<p>“Well, that stupid idiot’s opinion is wrong—”</p>

<p>Without looking up from his iPad, Max defended National Public
Radio—or semantics, in any case—from the backseat: “Opinions can’t be wrong.”</p>

<p>“So here’s why that idiot’s opinion is idiotic…” Irv ticked off
each “because” on the fingers of his left hand: “Because only an anti-Semite
can be provoked to anti-Semitism—a hideous phrase; because the mere suggestion
of a willingness to talk to these freaks would just be throwing Manischewitz on
an oil fire; because—not for nothing—their hospitals are filled with rockets
aimed at our hospitals, which are filled with them; because at the end of the
day, we love kung pao chicken and they love death; because—and this really
should have been my first point—the simple and undeniable fact is … we’re
right!”</p>

<p>“Jesus, watch your lane!”</p>

<p>Irv removed his other hand—balancing the wheel on his knees—to
acquire another rhetorical finger: “And because anyway, why should our
yarmulkes bunch over a troop of Goy Scouts earning protest patches in front of
the Berkeley Co-op, or simians in keffiyehs doing a little urban stone-skipping
in Gaza so-called City?”</p>

<p>“At least one hand on the wheel, Dad.”</p>

<p>“I’m getting in an accident?”</p>

<p>“And find a better word than simians.”</p>

<p>Irv turned to face his grandson while continuing to drive with
his knees: “You gotta hear this. You put a million monkeys in front of a
million typewriters and you get Hamlet. Two billion in front of two billion and
you get—”</p>

<p>“Watch the road!”</p>

<p>“The Koran. Funny, right?”</p>

<p>“Racist,” Max muttered.</p>

<p>“Arabs aren’t a race, bubeleh. They’re an ethnicity.”</p>

<p>“What’s a typewriter?”</p>

<p>“Let me also say this,” Irv said, turning to Jacob and pointing
his spare index finger while continuing to hold up the other six fingers.
“People in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones, but people with no homeland
really shouldn’t. Because when those stones of theirs start breaking Chagall
windows, don’t expect to see us on our knees with a dustpan. Just because we’re
smarter than those lunatics doesn’t mean they have a monopoly on insanity. The
Arabs have to understand that we’ve got some stones, too, but our slingshot’s
in Dimona, and the finger on the button is connected to an arm with a string of
numbers tattooed on it!”</p>

<p>“You’re finished?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“With what?”</p>

<p>“If I can host you back on the Blue Planet for just a second, I
was thinking we should take Tamir around to see Isaac on the way back.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s obviously depressed about the move and—”</p>

<p>“If he were capable of depression, he would have killed himself
seventy years ago.”</p>

<p>“Fucking shitcock!” Max said, shaking his iPad like an Etch A
Sketch.</p>

<p>“He’s not depressed,” Irv said. “He’s old. Age presents like
depression, but isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” Jacob said, “I forgot: no one is depressed.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m sorry, I forgot: everyone is depressed.”</p>

<p>“I assume that’s a dig at my therapy?”</p>

<p>“What belt are you up to, anyway? Brown? Black? And you win when
it’s around your neck?”</p>

<p>Jacob was weighing whether to give it back or let it go. Dr.
Silvers would call that binary thinking, but Dr. Silvers’s reliance on the
binary critique was, itself, binary. And this was too demanding a morning to
become nuanced with his anvil of a father. So, as always, he let it go. Or
rather, he absorbed it.</p>

<p>“It’s a tough change for him,” Jacob said. “It’s ultimate. I’m
just saying we should be sensitive—”</p>

<p>“He’s a human callus.”</p>

<p>“He’s an internal bleeder.”</p>

<p>Max pointed to the light: “Green is for go.”</p>

<p>But instead of driving, Irv turned to press the point from which
he’d strayed: “Here’s the deal: the world population of Jews falls within the
margin of error of the Chinese census, and everyone hates us.” Ignoring the honking
coming from behind him, he continued: “Europe … now, there’s a Jew-hating
continent. The French, those spineless vaginas, would shed no tears of sadness
over our disappearance.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about? Remember what the French prime
minister said after the attack on the kosher market? ‘Every Jew who leaves
France is a piece of France that is gone.’ Or something like that.”</p>

<p>“Bull-merde. You know he had a bottle of Château Sang de Juif
1942 airing out backstage to toast France’s missing piece. The English, the
Spanish, the Italians. These people live to make us die.” He stuck his head out
the window and hollered at the honking driver: “I’m an asshole, asshole! I’m
not deaf!” And then back to Jacob: “Our only reliable friends in Europe are the
Germans, and does anyone doubt that they’ll one day run out of guilt and
lampshades? And does anyone really doubt that one day, when the conditions are
right, America will decide we’re noisy, and smelly, and pushy, and way too
smart for anybody else’s good?”</p>

<p>“I do,” Max said, opening up a pinch to zoom in on something.</p>

<p>“Hey, Maxy,” Irv said, trying to catch his eye in the rearview
mirror, “you know why paleontologists look for bones and not anti-Semitism?”</p>

<p>“Because they’re paleontologists and not the ADL?” Jacob suggested.</p>

<p>“Because they like to dig. Get it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Even if everything you say is true,” Jacob said, “which it
isn’t—”</p>

<p>“Resolutely is.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t—”</p>

<p>“Is.”</p>

<p>“But even if it were—”</p>

<p>“The world hates Jews. I know you think the prevalence of Jews
in culture is some kind of counterargument, but that’s like saying the world
loves pandas because crowds come to see them in zoos. The world hates pandas.
Wants them dead. Even the cubs. And the world hates Jews. Always has. Always
will. Yeah, there are more polite words to use, and political contexts to cite,
but the hatred is always hatred and always because we’re Jewish.”</p>

<p>“I like pandas,” Max chimed in.</p>

<p>“You don’t,” Irv corrected.</p>

<p>“I would be psyched to have one as a pet.”</p>

<p>“It would eat your face, Maxy.”</p>

<p>“Awesome.”</p>

<p>“Or at least occupy our house and subject us to its sense of
entitlement,” Jacob added.</p>

<p>“The Germans murdered one and a half million Jewish children
because they were Jewish children, and they got to host the Olympics thirty
years later. And what a job they did with that! The Jews win by a hair a war
for our survival and are a permanent pariah state. Why? Why, only a generation
after our near-destruction, is the Jewish will to survive considered a will to
conquer? Ask yourself: Why?”</p>

<p>His why wasn’t a question, not even a rhetorical one. It was a
shove. A stiff arm in a time of forced hands. Everything had an aspect of
coercion. Isaac didn’t want to move; they were forcing him to. The singular
sense in which Sam wanted to become a man was sexual relations with a person
who wasn’t himself, but they were forcing him to apologize for words he said he
didn’t write, so that he could be forced to chant memorized words of unknown
meaning before family he didn’t believe in, and friends he didn’t believe in,
and God. Julia was being forced to shift her focus from ambitious buildings
that would never be built to the bathroom and kitchen renovations of
disappointed people with resources. And the phone incident was forcing an
examination that the marriage might not survive—their relationship, like all
relationships, dependent on willful blindness and forgetting. Even Irv’s
descent into bigotry was guided by an invisible hand.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to be a caricature. Nobody wants to be a diminished
version of herself. Nobody wants to be a Jewish man, or a dying man.</p>

<p>Jacob didn’t want to coerce or be coerced, but what was he
supposed to do? Sit on his hands waiting for his grandfather to shatter his hip
and die in a hospital room as every abandoned old person is destined to do?
Allow Sam to snip a ritualistic thread that reached back to kings and prophets,
simply because Judaism as they practiced it was boring as hell and overflowed
with hypocrisy? Maybe. In the rabbi’s office he’d felt ready to use the
scissors.</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia had batted about the notion of having the bar
mitzvah in Israel—the Jewish coming-of-age version of eloping. Perhaps that
would be a way to do it without doing it. Sam objected on the grounds of it
being a terrible idea.</p>

<p>“Terrible why?” Jacob asked, knowing full well why.</p>

<p>“You really don’t see the irony?” Sam said. Jacob saw many
ironies, and was curious to hear which one Sam was thinking of. “Israel was
created as a place for Jews to escape persecution. We would be going to escape
Judaism.” Nicely put.</p>

<p>So the bar mitzvah would be at the synagogue they paid
twenty-five hundred dollars per visit to be members of, and officiated by the
hip young rabbi who wasn’t, by any reasonable definition, hip, young, or a
rabbi. The party would be at the Hilton where Reagan was this close to being
put out of our misery, and where Julia and Sam were representing Micronesia.
The band would be capable of playing both a good horah and good rock. Of
course, such a band has never existed in the history of live music, but Jacob
knew that at a certain point you just crunch the capsule you’ve been hiding in
your cheek and hope not to feel too much. The theme—handled with delicacy and
taste—would be Sam’s Family’s Diaspora. (This was Julia’s idea, and insofar as
a bar mitzvah theme could ever be a good idea, it was sufficiently OK.) They
would have tables representing each of the countries the family had been
dispersed to—America, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Australia, South Africa,
Israel, Canada—and instead of seating cards, each guest would receive a
“passport” to one of the nations. The tables would be designed to reflect
regional culture and landmarks—this is where delicacy and taste were most
severely challenged—and the centerpieces would include a family tree, and
photographs of relatives currently living in those places. The buffet would
feature stations of regionally specific foods: Brazilian feijoada, Spanish
tapas, Israeli falafel, whatever they eat in Canada, and so on. The party
favors would be snow globes of the various locales. There are more wars than
snowfalls in Israel, but the Chinese are smart enough to know that Americans
are dumb enough to buy anything. Especially Jewish Americans, who will go to
any length, short of practicing Judaism, to instill a sense of Jewish identity
in their children.</p>

<p>“I asked you a question,” Irv said, bringing Jacob back to the
argument that only Irv was having.</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes: Why?”</p>

<p>“Why what?”</p>

<p>“The what doesn’t even matter. The answer is the same to every
question about us: Because the world hates Jews.”</p>

<p>Jacob turned to face Max. “You realize that genetics aren’t
destiny, right?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you say…”</p>

<p>“In much the same way that I escaped the baldness that ravaged
your grandfather’s head, you have a fighting chance of dodging the insanity
that transformed a passable human into the man who married my mother.”</p>

<p>Irv gave a deep, dramatic exhale, and then, with the full force
of his faux sincerity: “Would it be all right if I offered an opinion?”</p>

<p>Both Jacob and Max laughed at that. Jacob liked that feeling, that
spontaneous father-son camaraderie.</p>

<p>“Listen, don’t listen, it’s up to you. But I want to get this
off my chest. I think you’re wasting your life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all?” Jacob said. “I was bracing for something big.”</p>

<p>“I think you are an immensely talented, deeply feeling,
profoundly intelligent person.”</p>

<p>“The zayde doth protest too much, methinks.”</p>

<p>“And you have made some very bad choices.”</p>

<p>“I’m guessing you have a specific choice in mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, writing for that dumb TV show.”</p>

<p>“That dumb TV show is watched by four million people.”</p>

<p>“A: So what? B: Which four million?”</p>

<p>“And is critically acclaimed.”</p>

<p>“Those who can’t teach gym, acclaim.”</p>

<p>“And it’s my job. It’s how I support the family.”</p>

<p>“It’s how you make money. There are other ways to support a
family.”</p>

<p>“I should be a dermatologist? That would be a good use of my
talent, feeling, and intellect?”</p>

<p>“You should make something that befits your abilities and
expresses your definition of substance.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s of the epic dragon
adventure of someone who isn’t fit to spit shine your hemorrhoids. You weren’t
put on earth to do that.”</p>

<p>“And now you’re going to tell me what I was put on earth to do?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I’m going to do.”</p>

<p>Jacob sang: “Somewhere in my youth, or childhood, I must have
done something very bad.”</p>

<p>“As I was about to say—”</p>

<p>“High on his horse was my lonely dad, Irv, lay ee old lay ee old
lay hee hoo.”</p>

<p>“You’re witty—we get it, Fraukenstein.”</p>

<p>“Bad advice, bad advice, bless my homeland for never.”</p>

<p>This time leaving no room to fill: “Jacob, you should forge in
the smithy of your soul the uncreated conscience of your race.”</p>

<p>An underwhelmed “Wow.”</p>

<p>“Yes: wow.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind saying that once more, and projecting, for the
cheap seats in my brain?”</p>

<p>“You should forge in the smithy of your soul the uncreated
conscience of your race.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the ovens at Auschwitz do that?”</p>

<p>“They destroyed. I’m talking about forging.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate your sudden vote of confidence in me—”</p>

<p>“I just stuffed the ballot box.”</p>

<p>“—but my soul’s smithy doesn’t get that hot.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re so desperate to be loved. Friction
generates heat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t even know what that means.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same with the n-word business at Sam’s school.”</p>

<p>“We should probably leave Sam out of this,” Max suggested.</p>

<p>“It’s the same everywhere you look in your life,” Irv said.
“You’re making the same mistake we’ve been making for thousands of years—”</p>

<p>“We?”</p>

<p>“—believing that if we can only be loved, we’ll be safe.”</p>

<p>“My conversation GPS is on the fritz. We’re back to the hatred
of the Jews?”</p>

<p>“Back to? No. You can’t return to something you’ve never left.”</p>

<p>“The show is entertainment.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that you believe that.”</p>

<p>“Well, that sounds like the end of our road.”</p>

<p>“Because I’m ready to give you more credit than you’re ready to
give yourself?”</p>

<p>“Because as you’re often the first to point out, you can’t
negotiate without a negotiating partner.”</p>

<p>“Who’s negotiating?”</p>

<p>“You can’t converse.”</p>

<p>“Really, Jacob. Let down your guard for a second and ask
yourself: What is it with the ravenous need for love? You used to write such
honest books. Honest and emotionally ambitious. Maybe they weren’t finding
millions of readers. Maybe they weren’t making you rich. But they were making
the world rich.”</p>

<p>“And you hated them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right,” he said, switching lanes without checking
any of his mirrors, “I hated them. God forbid you should see my marginalia. But
do you know who hates your show?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my show.”</p>

<p>“Nobody. You’ve passed a lot of time for a lot of grateful
zombies.”</p>

<p>“So this is an argument against television?”</p>

<p>“That’s another argument I could make,” he said, taking the
airport exit. “But this is an argument against your show.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my show.”</p>

<p>“So get a show.”</p>

<p>“But I have nothing left to offer the tooth fairy in exchange.”</p>

<p>“Have you tried?”</p>

<p>“Have I tried?”</p>

<p>No one had tried harder. Not to get a show—it wasn’t yet the
time for that—but to write one. For more than a decade Jacob had been breaking
his soul’s back shoveling coal into the smithy. He’d devoted himself to the secret,
utterly futile task of redeeming his people through language. His people? His
family. His family? Himself. What self? And redeeming might not be quite the
right word.</p>

<p>Ever-Dying People was exactly what his father thought he was
hoping for—a shofar blast from a mountaintop. Or at least a silent cry from a
basement. But if Irv had ever been given the chance to read it, he would have
hated it—a far more expansive hatred than the one he felt for the novels.
Jacob’s definition of substance could get pretty ugly, but more, there were
some essential disagreements about whom the sharp point of the forged
conscience should be turned on.</p>

<p>And there was a far bigger problem: the show would kill Jacob’s
grandfather. Not metaphorically. It would literally commit grand-patricide. He
who could survive anything would never survive a mirror. So Jacob held it close
to his chest in a locked desk drawer. And the less able he was to share it, the
more devoted he felt to it.</p>

<p>The show began with the beginning of the writing of the show.
The characters in the show were the characters in the real Jacob’s life: an
unhappy wife (who didn’t want to be described that way); three sons: one on the
brink of manhood, one on the brink of extreme self-consciousness, one on the
brink of mental independence; a terrified, xenophobic father; a quietly weaving
and unweaving mother; a depressed grandfather. Should he one day share it and
be asked how autobiographical it was, he would say, “It’s not my life, but it’s
me.” And if someone—who else but Dr. Silvers?—were to ask how autobiographical
his life was, he would say, “It’s my life, but it’s not me.”</p>

<p>The writing kept pace with the changing events in Jacob’s life.
Or his life kept pace with the writing. Sometimes it was hard to tell. Jacob
wrote about the discovery of his phone months before he even bought a second
phone—psychology so double-left-handed it didn’t justify even one six-dollar
minute with Dr. Silvers and was given several dozen hours. But it wasn’t just
psychological. There were times when Julia would say or do things so eerily
similar to what Jacob had written that he had to wonder if she’d read it. The
night she discovered the phone, she asked, “Does it make you sad that we love
the kids more than we love each other?” That exact line—those words in that
order—had been in the script for months. Although they were Jacob’s.</p>

<p>Save for the moments that most people would do anything to
avoid, life is pretty slow and uninteresting and undramatic and uninspiring.
Jacob’s solution to that problem, or blessing, wasn’t to alter the drama of the
show—the authenticity of his work was the only antidote to the inauthenticity
of his life—but to generate more and more paraphernalia.</p>

<p>Twenty-four years earlier, around the time that his lack of
patience overwhelmed his passion for guitar, Jacob started designing album
covers for an imaginary band. He wrote track lists, and lyrics, and liner
notes. He thanked people who didn’t exist: engineers, producers, managers. He
copied&nbsp; language from Steady Diet of Nothing. An atlas at his side, he
created a U.S. tour, and then a world tour, giving thought to the limits of his
physical and emotional endurance: Is Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Copenhagen,
Barcelona, Madrid too much for one week? Especially after eight months on the
road? And even if it were endurable, what good would come from pushing the band
toward an irritability that would only jeopardize everything they believed in
and worked so hard to achieve? The dates were printed on the backs of T-shirts
he designed, and actually produced, and actually wore. But he couldn’t play
barre chords.</p>

<p>His relationship to the show was something like that—the more
stunted the reality, the more expansive the related materials.</p>

<p>He created, and perpetually added to, a “bible” for the show—a
kind of user’s manual for those who would one day work on it. He generated an
ever-adjusting dossier of background information on each of the characters—</p>

<p>SAM BLOCH</p>

<p>On the brink of 13. The eldest of the Bloch brothers. Spends
virtually all of his time in the virtual world of Other Life. Hates the fit of
all clothing. Loves watching videos of bullies getting knocked out. Incapable
of ignoring, or even not perceiving, sexual double entendres. Would take a body
covered with acne scarring in the future for a clear forehead in the present.
Longs for his positive qualities to be universally recognized but never
mentioned.</p>

<p>GERSHOM BLUMENBERG</p>

<p>Long dead. Son of Anshel, father of Isaac. Grandfather of
Irving. Grandson of someone whose name has been lost forever. Great Rabbi of
Drohobycz. Died in a burning synagogue. Namesake of a small park with cool
marble benches in Jerusalem. Appears only in nightmares.</p>

<p>JULIA BLOCH</p>

<p>43. Wife of Jacob. Architect, although secretly ashamed of
referring to herself as such, given that she’s never built a building.
Immensely talented, tragically overburdened, perpetually unappreciated,
seasonally optimistic. Often wonders if all it would take to completely change
her life would be a complete change of context.</p>

<p>—and a catalog of settings, which included short (if always
expanding) descriptions of place, hundreds of photographs for a future props
department, maps, floor plans, real estate listings, anecdotes—</p>

<p>2294 NEWARK STREET</p>

<p>Bloch House. Nicer than many, but not the nicest. But nice. If
not as nice as it could be. Thoughtful interiors, within the working limits.
Some good midcentury furniture, mostly through eBay and Etsy. Some IKEA
furniture with cool hacks (leather pulls, faceted cabinet fronts). Pictures
hung in clusters (equitably distributed between Jacob’s and Julia’s families).
Almond flour in a Williams-Sonoma glass jar on a soapstone counter. A
too-beautiful-to-use Le Creuset Dutch Oven in Mineral Blue on the back right
burner of a double-wide Lacanche range whose potential is wasted on veggie
chili. Some books that were bought to be read (or at least dipped into); others
to give the impression of a very specific kind of very broad-minded curiosity;
others, like the two-volume slipcased edition of The Man Without Qualities,
because of their beautiful spines. Hydrocortisone acetate suppositories beneath
a stack of New Yorkers in the middle drawer of the medicine cabinet. A vibrator
in the foot of a shoe on a high shelf. Holocaust books behind non-Holocaust
books. And running up the kitchen doorframe, a growth chart of the Bloch boys.</p>

<p>When it was time for me to move, I lingered at this threshold.
The doorframe was the only thing I couldn’t let go of. Forget the Papa Bear
Chair and forget its ottoman. Forget the candlesticks and lamps. Forget Blind
Botanist, the drawing we bought together, attributed to one of my heroes, Ben
Shahn, lacking any provenance. Forget the moody orchid. While Julia was out one
afternoon, I jimmied the doorframe loose from the wall with the aid of a
flathead screwdriver, slid it down the length of the Subaru (one end against
the glass of the hatchback, the other touching the windshield), and drove the
record of my children’s growth to a new house. Two weeks later, a housepainter
painted over it. I redid the lines to the best of my sorry memory.</p>

<p>—and most ambitiously (or neurotically, or pathetically): the
notes to the actors, striving to convey what the scripts on their own could
not, because more words were needed: HOW TO PLAY LATE LAUGHTER; HOW TO PLAY
“WHAT IS YOUR NAME?”; HOW TO PLAY SUICIDE GROWTH RINGS … Each episode was only
twenty-seven pages, give or take. Each season only ten episodes. There was room
for a little background, a few flashbacks and tangents and clumsy insertions of
information that didn’t drive the plot but filled out the motivation. So many
more words were needed: HOW TO PLAY THE NEED FOR DISSATISFACTION; HOW TO PLAY
LOVE; HOW TO PLAY THE DEATH OF LANGUAGE … The notes were Jewish-motherly in
their irrepressibly naggy didacticism, Jewish-fatherly in their need to obscure
every emotion in metaphor and deflection. HOW TO PLAY AMERICAN; HOW TO PLAY THE
GOOD BOY; HOW TO PLAY THE SOUND OF TIME … The bible quickly surpassed the
scripts themselves in length and depth—the explanatory material overwhelmed
what it attempted to explain. So Jewish. Jacob wanted to make something that
would redeem everything, and instead he was explaining, explaining, explaining
…</p>

<p>HOW TO PLAY THE SOUND OF TIME</p>

<p>The morning Julia found the phone, my parents were over for
brunch. Everything was falling apart around Benjy, although I’ll never know
what he knew at the time, and neither will he. The adults were talking when he
reentered the kitchen and said, “The sound of time. What happened to it?”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“You know,” he said, waving his tiny hand about, “the sound of
time.”</p>

<p>It took time—about five frustrating minutes—to figure out what
he was getting at. Our refrigerator was being repaired, so the kitchen lacked
its omnipresent, nearly imperceptible buzzing sound. He spent virtually all his
home life within reach of that sound, and so had come to associate it with life
happening.</p>

<p>I loved his misunderstanding, because it wasn’t a
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>My grandfather heard the cries of his dead brothers. That was
the sound of his time.</p>

<p>My father heard attacks.</p>

<p>Julia heard the boys’ voices.</p>

<p>I heard silences.</p>

<p>Sam heard betrayals and the sounds of Apple products turning on.</p>

<p>Max heard Argus’s whining.</p>

<p>Benjy was the only one still young enough to hear home.</p>

<p>Irv lowered all four windows and told Jacob, “You lack
strength.”</p>

<p>“And you lack intelligence. Together we make a fully incomplete
person.”</p>

<p>“Seriously, Jacob. What is the ravenous need for love?”</p>

<p>“Seriously, Dad. What is the ravenous need for that diagnosis?”</p>

<p>“I’m not diagnosing you. I’m explaining yourself to you.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t need love?”</p>

<p>“As a grandfather, yes. As a father and son, yes. As a Jew? No.
So some fifth-tier British university won’t let us participate in their
ridiculous conference on recent advances in marine biology? Who cares? Stephen
Hawking won’t come to Israel? I’m not one to punch a quadriplegic with glasses,
but I’m sure he won’t mind if we ask for his voice back—you know, the one that
was created by Israeli engineers. And while we’re at it, I’ll happily lose my
seat at the United-Against-Israel Nations if it means I can keep my ass. Jews
have become the smartest weakest people in the history of the world. Look, I’m
not always right. I realize that. But I’m always strong. And if our history has
taught us anything, it’s that it’s more important to be strong than right. Or
good, for that matter. I would rather be alive and wrong and evil. I don’t need
Bishop Wears-a-Tutu, or that hydrocephalic peanut farmer president, or the
backseat-driving pseudo-sociologist eunichs from the New York Times op-ed page,
or anyone, to give me their blessing. I don’t need to be a Light unto the
Nations; I need to not be on fire. Life is long when you’re alive, and history
has a short memory. America had its way with the Indians. Australia and Germany
and Spain … They did what had to be done. And what was the big deal? Their
history books have a few regrettable pages? They have to issue weak-tea
apologies once a year and pay out some reparations to the unfinished parts of
the job? They did what had to be done, and life went on.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’m just saying.”</p>

<p>“What? That Israel should commit genocide?”</p>

<p>“That word is yours.”</p>

<p>“It’s what you meant.”</p>

<p>“I said, and meant, that Israel should be a self-respecting,
self-defending country like any other.”</p>

<p>“Like Nazi Germany.”</p>

<p>“Like Germany. Like Iceland. Like America. Like every country
that’s ever existed and not stopped existing.”</p>

<p>“Sounds inspiring.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t be pretty while it was happening, but twenty years
from now, with fifty million Jews filling the Land of Israel, from the Suez
Canal all the way to the oil fields, with the largest economy between Germany
and China—”</p>

<p>“Israel isn’t between Germany and China.”</p>

<p>“—with the Olympics in Tel Aviv and more tourists in Jerusalem
than Paris, you think anyone is going to be going on about how the kosher
sausage was made?”</p>

<p>Irv took a deep breath and nodded his head, as if in agreement
with something only he had access to.</p>

<p>“The world will always hate Jews. On to the next thought, which
is: What to do with that hatred? We can deny it, or try to overcome it. We
could even choose to join the club and hate ourselves.”</p>

<p>“The club?”</p>

<p>“You know the membership: Jews who would sooner fix their
so-called deviated septums than break a nose for their survival; Jews who
refuse to acknowledge that Tina Fey isn’t Jewish, or that the IDF is;
ersatz-quote Jews like Ralph Lauren (né Lifshitz), Winona Ryder (née Horowitz),
George Soros, Mike Wallace, pretty much all Jews living in the United Kingdom,
Billy Joel, Tony Judt, Bob Silvers—”</p>

<p>“Billy Joel isn’t Jewish.”</p>

<p>“Of course he is.”</p>

<p>“‘Scenes from an Italian Restaurant’?”</p>

<p>“Chinese restaurant, no?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Point is, a Jewish fist can do more than masturbate and hold a
pen. Slide out the writing implement, you’ve got a punching implement. You
understand? We don’t need another Einstein. We need a Koufax who pitches at the
head.”</p>

<p>“Did it ever occur to you—” Jacob began.</p>

<p>“Yes, it probably did.”</p>

<p>“—that I don’t include myself in your we?”</p>

<p>“Did it ever occur to you that the meshuggener mullah with the
nuclear codes does?”</p>

<p>“So our identity is at the mercy of crazy strangers?”</p>

<p>“If you can’t generate it yourself.”</p>

<p>“What do you want from me? To spy for Israel? To blow myself up
in a mosque?”</p>

<p>“I want you to write something that matters.”</p>

<p>“First of all, what I write matters to a lot of people.”</p>

<p>“No, it entertains them.”</p>

<p>Jacob remembered the previous night’s conversation with Max, and
considered pointing out that his show generated more revenue than every book
published in America that entire year combined. That might not have been true,
but he would know how to play false authority.</p>

<p>“I take your silence to mean you understand me,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“How about you stick to the bigoted blogging, and I’ll take care
of award-winning television?”</p>

<p>“Hey, Maxy, you know who made the award-winning entertainment in
the time of the Maccabees?”</p>

<p>“Pray tell,” he said, blowing dust from his screen.</p>

<p>“I can’t, because we only remember the Maccabees.”</p>

<p>What Jacob really thought: his father was an ignorant,
narcissistic, self-righteous pig, too anal-retentive and pussy-whipped to grasp
the extreme reaches of his hypocrisy, emotional impotence, and mental infancy.</p>

<p>“So we’re in agreement, then?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“So we’re agreed?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you agree with me.”</p>

<p>But there were arguments for forgiving him, too. There were.
Good ones. Beautiful intentions. Wounds.</p>

<p>Jacob’s phone rang. His real phone. It was Julia. The real
Julia. He would have leaped through any open or closed window to escape the
conversation with his father, but he was afraid of answering.</p>

<p>“Hi?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“I bet.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Do they even have room for it?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“I figured. Not the bomb part, but—”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“I’m in the car.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Their flight is arriving early.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Max did.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Max, do you want to say hi to Mom?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Are you in the hotel? I hear nature.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Tell her hi.”</p>

<p>“My dad says hi.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“She says hi.”</p>

<p>“And that Benjy had a great time at our house, and didn’t die.”</p>

<p>“He wants you to know that Benjy had a great time at his house.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“She says thanks.”</p>

<p>“Tell her I say hi.”</p>

<p>“Max says hi.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“She says hi.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Let’s see. Argus is very old. That was reconfirmed. We got some
new pills for joint pain, and they upped the dosage on the other one. He’ll
live to bark another day.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Nothing to be done. The vet gave the spiel about what an honor
it is to care for loved ones, how it only happens once.”</p>

<p>“No she didn’t,” Max said.</p>

<p>Jacob shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“And tell her the vet thinks we should put Argus down.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” Jacob told Julia, then muted the phone.</p>

<p>“That’s not what the vet said, Max.”</p>

<p>“Tell her.”</p>

<p>Jacob unmuted the phone and said, “Max wants me to communicate
that the vet thinks we should put Argus down, although the vet said no such
thing.”</p>

<p>“She did, Mom!”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“She did.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“We had a nice conversation about quality of life and so on.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“I took him to Fort Reno on the way, told him some stories about
when I was a kid.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Ate McDonald’s.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Burritos.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“No, microwaved.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Of course. Carrots. Hummus, too.”</p>

<p>With a few movements of his hand, Jacob communicated to Max that
Julia had asked if he’d eaten vegetables.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Will do.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“One other thing is that last night we had a little snafu with
Sam’s avatar.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“In Other Life. His avatar. We were messing around with it.”</p>

<p>“You were,” Max corrected.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“No, probably not. Max was fiddling with it—”</p>

<p>“What? Dad, that’s just not true. Mom, it’s not true!”</p>

<p>“And I wanted to, you know, display interest, and we ended up
doing it together. Nothing dramatic. Just walking around and exploring. Anyway,
we killed her.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t. You did. Mom: Dad killed her!”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“His avatar. Yes.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Unintended.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“You can’t fix death, Julia.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“I spent a couple of months on the phone with tech support last
night. I can probably get it back to more or less where it was, but it’s going
to require sitting at his computer until the Messiah calls me away.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“I haven’t spoken to Cory in at least a year.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“It would be shitty to call him like this after not having
returned his calls.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“And I don’t think a computer genius is what we need. I’ll
figure it out. But enough about the sickness and death over here. How are you
guys? Having fun?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“You’ve met the infamous Billie?”</p>

<p>“Infamous Billie?” Irv asked Max in the rearview mirror.</p>

<p>“Sam’s girlfriend,” Max said.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“And?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“What’s he like around her?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t take it personally.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“And Mark?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Is it good having him there?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Has he had to flush any pot down the toilet, or break up a
French-kissing session?”</p>

<p>“French kissing is with tongues, right?” Max asked Irv.</p>

<p>“Mais oui.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong. I can hear it.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Now I know something’s wrong.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“OK, but can you at least tell me what it has to do with, so my
mind doesn’t spiral wildly for the next six hours?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Julia. What’s going on?”</p>

<p>“Seriously, what is going on?” Irv said, finally interested.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“If it were nothing we wouldn’t still be talking about it.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“OK, I get it.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Wait, what?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Julia?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Mark did?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Why the fuck did he do that?”</p>

<p>“Language,” Max said.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“He’s married.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“But he was.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do? Stab a voodoo doll of myself?”</p>

<p>Jacob turned up the radio to make his conversation harder for
his father and son to listen in on. An English grammarian was sharing her
infatuation with auto-antonyms: words that are their own opposites. Oversight
means both “to oversee” and “to fail to see.” You dust a cake with sugar, dust
crops with pesticides; but when furniture is dusted, something is being
removed. The house weathered the storm, but the shingles were weathered.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“That isn’t fair.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But it’s also what people say when something isn’t
fair.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Of course it is.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“So this is just the most hysterical coincidence of timing
since—”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“So please tell me what it’s about. If not balance, then—?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Great.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Great.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“The way I do it, yes.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Both.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Jacob said. And then, to Julia: “Max asked me what
happened.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“But you’re upset,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Life is upsetting,” Irv said. “Like blood is wet.”</p>

<p>“Scabs,” Max pointed out.</p>

<p>Jacob turned the volume yet louder, to the point of aggression.
He was fast until his feet were held fast in concrete. The earth was held up by
Atlas, and the earth held Atlas up on his way to elsewhere. After she left, no
one was left.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“There is no of course anymore.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Are you coming home?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, Julia. I really don’t.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“But you told me, in bed the other night, that it was something
you—”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“You just said you didn’t stop it. I can’t believe this. I can’t
believe you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you guys should get a room?” Irv said to Jacob in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Now I get it. Why you didn’t call last night.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Does Micronesia even have a bomb?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>Jacob hung up.</p>

<p>They were in battle against each other, and they had served
together in battle.</p>

<p>“Jesus,” Irv said. “What the hell was that about?”</p>

<p>“That was about—”</p>

<p>“Dad?”</p>

<p>For only long enough to be able to dismiss it, Jacob considered
telling his father and son everything. That would feel good, but at the price
of his goodness.</p>

<p>“That. That was about a whole bunch of logistical crap, having
to do with when they’re coming home later, and where the Israelis will sleep,
and what they’ll eat, and so on.”</p>

<p>Of course Irv didn’t believe him. And of course Max didn’t,
either. But Jacob almost believed himself.</p>

<p>He cleaved to the life from which he cleaved himself.</p>

<h2>THE L-WORD</h2>

<p>Billie was preparing her remarks for the General Assembly—after
the unproductive caucus of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Micronesian
delegation reconvened in Mark’s room and argued well past their scheduled
curfew, narrowly voting to hand the bomb over to whatever competent and
trustworthy third party could safely disarm it and dispose of the nuclear
material—when her phone sang the first two words of Adele’s “Someone Like You,”
just enough to unleash a Charybdis of feelings without revealing to others that
she didn’t find the song totally cheesy. It was the special tone for Sam’s
texts; she had been holding her phone in her hand since the night before,
wanting and not wanting to hear I heard.</p>

<p>are you working on your speech?</p>

<p>what makes you think i want to talk to you?</p>

<p>that you just wrote that</p>

<p>where’d you go?</p>

<p>had to look up guernica</p>

<p>you could have just asked</p>

<p>nobody is like you, and you are never</p>

<p>like anybody else</p>

<p>did you get that off the side of a tampon box?</p>

<p>???</p>

<p>try harder</p>

<p>emet hi hasheker hatov beyoter</p>

<p>did you just say the hardest thing?</p>

<p>no, that was the easiest</p>

<p>why were you so mean to me?</p>

<p>can i tell you something?</p>

<p>ok</p>

<p>when i was eight, my left hand got smashed</p>

<p>in the hinge of a heavy iron door</p>

<p>three of my fingers were severed</p>

<p>and had to be reattached</p>

<p>the nails are all mangled</p>

<p>when my hand stops growing i’m going</p>

<p>to have fake nails attached</p>

<p>anyway, i keep my hand in my pocket a lot</p>

<p>and when i’m sitting i’ll</p>

<p>slide it under my thigh</p>

<p>i know</p>

<p>a few times i’ve wanted</p>

<p>to touch your face</p>

<p>really?</p>

<p>many, many times</p>

<p>then why didn’t you?</p>

<p>my hand</p>

<p>you were afraid of me seeing it?</p>

<p>yes</p>

<p>and also of me seeing it</p>

<p>you could have used your other hand</p>

<p>i want to touch you with that hand</p>

<p>that’s the point</p>

<p>that’s the hand i want you to touch me with</p>

<p>really?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>where’d you go?</p>

<p>i just pressed my phone to my heart</p>

<p>i could hear it beating</p>

<p>even though we’re not on the phone?</p>

<p>yes</p>

<p>you can touch my face if you want to</p>

<p>i text like achilles</p>

<p>but i’m a pussy in real life</p>

<p>i’m a feminist in real life</p>

<p>you know i meant that idiomatically</p>

<p>yes, i know you are not a vagina</p>

<p>then i really have you fooled</p>

<p>i will never write lol</p>

<p>i’m sorry i hurt you</p>

<p>why did you do it?</p>

<p>because it was a cowardly</p>

<p>way to hurt myself</p>

<p>what was so hard about it was that</p>

<p>i always feel like i understand you</p>

<p>but last night i didn’t</p>

<p>it scared me</p>

<p>do you accept my apology?</p>

<p>as franz rosenzweig famously responded</p>

<p>did you ever wonder why it even mattered</p>

<p>if achilles was wounded in the heel</p>

<p>because that was the only part of him</p>

<p>that wasn’t immortal</p>

<p>so? so he’d be an immortal with a limp</p>

<p>i’m guessing you know why</p>

<p>i do</p>

<p>i’d really, really, really like to know</p>

<p>really, really, really, really, really</p>

<p>until you broke the word “like”</p>

<p>into a million pieces</p>

<p>into love</p>

<p>so tell me</p>

<p>it’s not just that his heel was</p>

<p>the only mortal part of him</p>

<p>ALL of his mortality was in his heel</p>

<p>—like moving everyone in a skyscraper</p>

<p>into the basement, and then it floods</p>

<p>and people who work on different floors,</p>

<p>and never otherwise would have met,</p>

<p>talk, and decide to go out to dinner,</p>

<p>and keep going out to dinner,</p>

<p>and meet each other’s family,</p>

<p>and celebrate holidays together,</p>

<p>and get married, and have</p>

<p>kids, who have kids, who have kids</p>

<p>but they drowned</p>

<p>so?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>MAYBE IT WAS THE DISTANCE</h2>

<p>Jacob was the only one who referred to the Israeli cousins as
our Israeli cousins. To everyone else in the house, they were the Israeli
cousins. Jacob felt no desire for ownership of them, and too much association
made him itchy, but he felt that they were owed familial warmth commensurate
with the thickness of blood. Or he felt that he should feel that. It would have
been easier if they’d been easier.</p>

<p>He’d known Tamir since they were children. Jacob’s grandfather
and Tamir’s were brothers in a Galician shtetl of such minuscule size and
importance that the German people didn’t get to it until their second pass
through the Pale to wipe up Jewish crumbs. There had been seven brothers. Isaac
and Benny avoided the fate of the other five by hiding together in a hole for
more than two hundred days, and then living in forests. Every story Jacob overheard
about this period—Benny could have killed a Nazi; Isaac could have saved a
Jewish boy—suggested a dozen stories that he would never overhear.</p>

<p>The brothers spent a year in a displaced persons camp, where
they met their wives, who were sisters. Each couple had a child, each a boy:
Irv and Shlomo. Benny moved his family to Israel, and Isaac moved his to
America. Isaac never understood Benny. Benny understood Isaac, but never
forgave him.</p>

<p>Within two years, Isaac and his wife, Sarah, had opened a Jewish
bodega in a schwartze neighborhood, learned enough English to begin working the
system, and started saving. Irv learned the infield fly rule, learned the
alphabetic/syllabic logic of D.C. street naming, learned to be ashamed of his
house’s look and smell, and one morning his forty-two-year-old mother went
downstairs to open the store, but instead collapsed and died. Died of what? Of
a heart attack. Of a stroke. Of surviving. A silence so high and thick was
built around her death that not only did no one know any significant details,
no one even knew what others knew. Many decades later, at his father’s funeral,
Irv would allow himself to wonder if his mother had killed herself.</p>

<p>Everything was something never to remember, or never to forget,
and what America had done for them was retold and retold. As Jacob grew, his
grandfather would regale him with stories of America’s glory: how the army had
fed and clothed him after the war; how at Ellis Island they never asked him to
change his name (it was his own choice); how one was limited only by one’s
willingness to work; how he’d never experienced anything that carried even the
faintest whiff of anti-Semitism—only indifference, which is greater than love,
because it’s more reliable.</p>

<p>The brothers would visit each other every few years, as if the
performance of familial intimacy would retroactively defeat the German people
and save everyone. Isaac would lavish Benny and his family with
expensive-looking tchotchkes, take them to the “best” second-tier restaurants,
close the market for a week to show them the sights of Washington. And when
they left, he’d spend twice as long as their visit bemoaning how big-headed and
tiny-minded they were, how American Jews were Jews and these Israeli crackpots
were Hebrews—people who, given their way, would sacrifice animals and serve
kings. Then he’d reiterate how necessary it was to maintain closeness.</p>

<p>Jacob found the Israeli cousins—his Israeli cousins—curious, at
once alien and familiar. He saw his family’s faces in their faces, but also
something different, something that could equally well be described as ignorant
or unself-conscious, phony or free—hundreds of thousands of years of evolution
crammed into one generation. Perhaps it was existential constipation, but the
Israelis didn’t seem to give a shit about anything. All Jacob’s family ever did
was give shits. They were shit-givers.</p>

<p>Jacob first visited Israel when he was fourteen—an overdue
present that he didn’t want for a bar mitzvah he didn’t went. The next
generation of Blumenbergs took the next generation of Blochs to the Wailing
Wall, into whose cracks Jacob inserted prayers for things he didn’t actually
care about but knew he ought to, like a cure for AIDS and an unbroken ozone
layer. They floated in the Dead Sea together, among the ancient, elephantine
Jews reading half-submerged newspapers bleeding Cyrillic. They climbed Masada
early in the morning and pocketed rocks that might have been held in the palms
of Jewish suicides. They watched the windmill break the sunset from the perch
of Mishkenot Sha’ananim. They went to the small park named after Jacob’s
great-grandfather Gershom Blumenberg. He had been a beloved rabbi, and his
surviving disciples remained loyal to his memory, choosing never to have
another rabbi, choosing their own demise. It was 105 degrees. The marble bench
was cool, but the metal plaque with his name was too hot to touch.</p>

<p>One
morning, while they were driving to a hike along the sea, an air-raid siren
went off. Jacob’s eyes opened to half dollars and found Irv’s. Shlomo stopped
the car. Right there, where it was, on the highway. “Did we break down?” Irv
asked, as if the siren might have been indicating a cracked catalytic
converter. Shlomo and Tamir got out of the car with the vacant determination of
zombies. Everyone on the highway got out of cars and cargo trucks, off
motorcycles. They stood, thousands of Jewish undead, perfectly silent. Jacob
didn’t know if this was the end, a kind of proud greeting of nuclear winter, or
a drill, or some national custom. Like dupes in a grand social psychology
experiment, Jacob and his parents did as everyone else was doing, and stood by
the car in silence. When the siren stopped, life reanimated. Everyone got back
in the car and they were on their way.</p>

<p>Irv
was apparently too afraid of revealing ignorance to resolve his ignorance, so
Deborah was left to ask what had just happened.</p>

<p>“Yom
HaShoah,” Shlomo said.</p>

<p>“That’s
the one for the trees?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“For
the Jews,” Shlomo said, “the ones that were chopped down.”</p>

<p>“Shoah,”
Irv said to Jacob, as if he’d known everything all along, “means ‘Holocaust.’”</p>

<p>“But
why does everyone stop and stand in silence?”</p>

<p>Shlomo
said, “Because it feels less wrong than anything else we might do.”</p>

<p>“And
what is everyone facing?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>Shlomo
said, “Himself.”</p>

<p>Jacob
was both mesmerized and repulsed by the ritual. The Jewish American response to
the Holocaust was “Never forget,” because there was a possibility of
forgetting. In Israel, they blared the air-raid siren for two minutes, because
otherwise it would never stop blaring.</p>

<p>Shlomo
was as over-the-top a host as Benny had been. He was further over, untethered
as he was from the dignity of survival. And dignity was never Irv’s problem. So
there were many scenes, especially when the check came at the end of a meal.</p>

<p>“Don’t
touch that!”</p>

<p>“Don’t
you touch that!”</p>

<p>“Don’t
insult me!”</p>

<p>“Me
insult you?”</p>

<p>“You’re
our guests!”</p>

<p>“You’re
our hosts!”</p>

<p>“I’ll
never eat with you again.”</p>

<p>“Count
on it.”</p>

<p>More
than once this competitive generosity escalated to genuine insult. More than
once—twice—perfectly good money was ripped up. Did everyone win, or did
everyone lose? Why so binary?</p>

<p>What
Jacob remembered most sharply and tenderly was the time they spent in the
Blumenbergs’ home, a two-story Art Deco–ish construction perched on a Haifan
hill. Every surface was made of stone and cool enough to be felt through socks
at every time of day—an entire house like the bench in Blumenberg Park. There
were diagonally sliced cucumbers and cubes of cheese for breakfast. Jaunts to
weirdly specific two-room “zoos”: a snake zoo, a small-mammal zoo. Tamir’s
mother would make huge spreads of side dishes for lunch—half a dozen salads,
half a dozen dips. At home, the Blochs made a point of trying not to turn on
the TV. The Blumenbergs made a point of trying not to turn it off.</p>

<p>Tamir
was obsessed with computers and had a library of RGB porn before Jacob had word
processing. In those days, Jacob concealed dirty magazines inside reference
books at Barnes &amp; Noble, searched lingerie catalogs for nipples and pubes
with the dedication of a Talmudist searching for God’s will, and listened to
the moans of the visually blocked but aurally exposed Spice channel. The
greatest of lewd treats was the three minutes of preview that hotels used to
offer for all movies: family, adult, adult. Even as a teenager, Jacob
recognized the masturbatory tautology: if three minutes of the adult film
convinced you that it was a worthy adult film, you would no longer have need of
it. Tamir’s computer took half a day to download a titty fuck, but what else
was time made for?</p>

<p>Once,
while they watched a pixelated woman jerkily spread and close her legs—an
animation composed of six frames—Tamir asked if Jacob felt like beating off.</p>

<p>Jacob
gave an ironic, Tom Brokaw–voiced “No,” assuming his cousin was joking.</p>

<p>“Suit
yourself,” Tamir said, and proceeded to suit himself, pumping a glob of shea
butter moisturizer into his palm.</p>

<p>Jacob
watched him remove his hard penis from his pants and begin to stroke it,
transferring the cream to its length. After a minute or two of this, Tamir got
up onto his knees, bringing the head of his penis within inches of the
screen—close enough for static shock. His penis was wide, Jacob had to give it
that. But he wasn’t convinced it was any longer than his own. He wasn’t
convinced that in the dark one would be able to tell the difference between
their penises.</p>

<p>“How
does it feel?” Jacob asked, while simultaneously reprimanding himself for
voicing such a creepy question.</p>

<p>And
then, as if in response, Tamir grabbed a Kleenex from the box on his desk and
moaned as he shot a load into it.</p>

<p>Why
had Jacob asked that? And why had Tamir come right then? Had Jacob’s question
made him come? Had that been Jacob’s (totally subconscious) intent?</p>

<p>They
masturbated side by side a dozen or so times. They certainly never touched each
other, but Jacob did wonder if Tamir’s quiet moans were always irrepressible—if
there wasn’t something performative about them. They never spoke about such
sessions after—not three minutes after, and not three decades—but they weren’t
a source of shame for either of them. They were young enough at the time not to
worry about meaning, and then old enough to revere what was lost.</p>

<p>Pornography
was only one example of the chasm between their life experiences. Tamir walked
himself to school before Jacob’s parents would leave him at a drop-off birthday
party. Tamir cooked his own dinner, while an airplane full of dark green
vegetables searched for a landing strip in Jacob’s mouth. Tamir drank beer
before Jacob, smoked pot before Jacob, got a blowjob before Jacob, got arrested
before Jacob (who would never be arrested), traveled abroad before Jacob, had
his heart created by having his heart broken before Jacob. When Tamir was given
an M16, Jacob was given a Eurail pass. Tamir tried without success to stay out
of risky situations; Jacob tried without success to find his way into them. At
nineteen, Tamir was in a half-buried outpost in south Lebanon, behind four feet
of concrete. Jacob was in a dorm in New Haven whose bricks had been buried for
two years before construction so that they would look older than they were.
Tamir didn’t resent Jacob—he would have been Jacob, given the choice—but he had
lost some of the lightness necessary to appreciate someone as light as his
cousin. He’d fought for his homeland, while Jacob spent entire nights debating
whether that stupid New Yorker poster where New York is bigger than everything
else would look better on this wall or that one. Tamir tried not to get killed,
while Jacob tried not to die of boredom.</p>

<p>After his service, Tamir was
finally free to live on his own terms. He became hugely ambitious, in the sense
of wanting to make shitloads of money and buy loads of shit. He dropped out of
Technion after a year and founded the first of a series of high-tech start-ups.
Almost all of them were flops, but it doesn’t take many nonflops to make your
first five million. Jacob was too jealous to give Tamir the pleasure of
explaining what his companies did, but it wasn’t hard to surmise that, like
most Israeli high tech, they applied military technologies to civilian life.</p>

<p>Tamir’s homes and cars and ego and
girlfriends’ breasts got bigger every visit. Jacob put on a respectful face
that revealed just the right amount of disapproval, but in the end, all his
emotional dog whistles were rendered pointless by Tamir’s emotional
tone-deafness. Why couldn’t Jacob just be happy for his cousin’s happiness?
Tamir was as good a person as just about anyone, whose great success made his
good-enough values increasingly difficult to act on. It’s confusing to have
more than you need. Who could blame him?</p>

<p>Jacob could. Jacob could because he
had less than he needed—he was an honorable, ambitious, near-broke novelist who
barely ever wrote—and that wasn’t in any way confusing. Nothing was getting
bigger in his life—it was a constant struggle to maintain the sizes he’d
established—and people without fancy material possessions have their fancy
values to flaunt.</p>

<p>Isaac always favored Tamir. Jacob
could never figure out why. His grandfather seemed to have serious problems
with all his post–bar mitzvah relatives, very much including those who forced
their children to skype with him once a week, and took him to doctors, and
drove him to distant supermarkets where one could buy six tins of baking powder
for the price of five. Everyone ignored Isaac, but no one less than Jacob, and
no one more than Tamir. Yet Isaac would have traded six Jacobs for five Tamirs.</p>

<p>Tamir. Now, he’s a good grandson.</p>

<p>Even if he wasn’t all that good, or
in any way his grandson.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the distance Isaac
loved. Maybe the absence allowed for a mythology, while Jacob was cursed to be
judged by the increments he fell short of perfect menschiness.</p>

<p>Jacob tried to persuade Tamir to
come see Isaac before the move to the Jewish Home. There were eighteen months
of purgatory as they waited for someone to die and free up a room. But Tamir
denied the significance of the event.</p>

<p>“I’ve moved six times in the last
ten years,” he e-mailed, although like this: “iv mvd 6 tms n lst 10 yrs,” as if
English were as vowelless as Hebrew. Or as if there were no possible way for
him to give less of a shit about the message.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Jacob wrote back, “but
never to an assisted-living facility.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come when he dies, OK?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that visit will mean
as much to him.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll be there for Sam’s bar
mitzvah,” Tamir responded, although at that point it was still a year away and
definitively happening.</p>

<p>“I hope he makes it that long,”
Jacob wrote.</p>

<p>“You sound like him.”</p>

<p>The year passed, Isaac survived, as
was his way, and so did the insolent Jews squatting in the various rooms that
were his birthright. But then, finally, the exasperating wait was over: someone
shattered his hip and died, bringing Isaac to the top of the list. Sam’s bar
mitzvah was finally upon him. And according to Jacob’s phone, the Israelis were
in their final descent.</p>

<p>“Listen,” Jacob told Max as Irv
pulled into a parking spot, “our Israeli cousins—”</p>

<p>“Your Israeli cousins.”</p>

<p>“Our Israeli cousins are not the
easiest people in the world—”</p>

<p>“We’re the easiest people in the
world?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the one thing the
Arabs get right,” Irv said, annoyed by the angle at which a car was parked.
“They don’t give women licenses.”</p>

<p>“We’re the second-most-difficult
people in the world,” Jacob told Max. “After your Israeli cousins. But the
point I’m trying to make is don’t judge the State of Israel by the
stubbornness, arrogance, and materialism of our cousins.”</p>

<p>“Also known as fortitude,
righteousness, and ingenuity,” Irv said, turning off the car.</p>

<p>“It’s not their Israeliness,” Jacob
said, “it’s just them. And they’re ours.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>IN THE END, ONE’S HOME IS PERFECT</h2>

<p>There were rolls of bubble wrap in
the basement, like rolls of hay in a field in a painting—dozens of liters of
trapped air that had been saved for years for an occasion that would never
come.</p>

<p>The walls were bare: the bequeathed
awards and diplomas had been taken down, the ketubahs, reproductions of posters
for Chagall exhibits, wedding photos and graduation photos and bar mitzvah
photos and bris photos and framed sonogram images. So many framed pictures, as
if he’d been trying to conceal the walls. And in their absence, so many
rectangles of discoloration.</p>

<p>The made-in-China tchotchkes had
been removed from the china cabinet’s shelves and put in its drawers.</p>

<p>On the refrigerator, unbleached
rectangles indicated where the gorgeous, genius, tumorless great-grandchildren
used to be—all that remained were three class portraits, six closed eyes. The
Vishniacs had been touched for the first time in a decade, moved to the floor,
and those photos and cards that once covered the fridge now covered the coffee
table, each in its own ziplock sandwich bag. It was for this moment that Isaac
had saved all those baggies—washed them out after use, slid them over the
faucet to dry.</p>

<p>On the bed were more piles of
things still to be distributed to loved ones. The last couple of years had been
an extended process of giving away everything he owned, and what remained, now,
was hardest to let go of—not because of sentimental attachment, but because who
would ever want such things? He’d had some genuinely decent silver. Charming
porcelain teacups. And if you could imagine going to the trouble and expense of
reupholstering, a non-ironic argument could be made to save a few of the
chairs. But who would be willing to take home, or even to the nearest dumpster,
wrapping paper that still held the creases of the boxes it had once covered?</p>

<p>Who would want the Post-it pads,
totes, tiny spiral notebooks, and oversized pens, given as promotional items by
pharmaceutical companies and taken because they were there?</p>

<p>That box of petrified jelly beans,
pinched from the kiddush honoring the birth of someone who was now an
obstetrician. Would anyone want that?</p>

<p>Having no visitors, he had no need
for coat storage, so the entry closet was a good place to store more of the
bubble wrap he didn’t need. In the summer the bubbles expanded and the closet
door strained—the hinge pins turning counterclockwise by thousandths of a
degree from the pressure.</p>

<p>Who among the living would want
what he had left to give?</p>

<p>And what interruption of the
stillness, what sudden disturbance, awakened the fizz of the last ginger ale in
the fridge?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>HERE COME THE ISRAELIS!</h2>

<p>Tamir managed to pull three rolling
suitcases behind him while carrying two duty-free bags overflowing with—what?
What dignity-free doodie could he possibly need enough of to make his cousins
wait that much longer? Swatches? Cologne? A massive plastic M&amp;M filled with
tiny chocolate M&amp;M’s?</p>

<p>The surprise upon seeing him never
diminished. Here was someone with whom Jacob shared more genetic material than
just about anyone else on earth, and yet how many passersby would even guess
they were related? His skin color could be explained by exposure to the sun,
and the differences in their builds attributed to diet and exercise and
willpower, but what about his sharp jaw, his overhanging brow, the hair on his
knuckles and head? What about the size of his feet, his perfect eyesight, his
ability to grow a full beard while a bagel toasted?</p>

<p>He went right to Jacob, like an
Iron Dome interceptor, took him into his arms, kissed him with his full mouth,
then held him at arm’s length. He squeezed Jacob’s shoulders and looked him up
and down, as if he were contemplating eating or raping him.</p>

<p>“Apparently we aren’t children
anymore!”</p>

<p>“Not even our children are
children.”</p>

<p>His chest was broad and firm. It
would have made a good surface on which someone like Jacob could write about
someone like Tamir.</p>

<p>Once again, he held Jacob at arm’s
length.</p>

<p>“What’s your shirt mean?” Jacob
asked.</p>

<p>“Funny, no?”</p>

<p>“I think so, but I’m not sure I get
it.”</p>

<p>“‘You look like I need a drink.’
You know, you look like I need a drink.”</p>

<p>“What, like, you’re so ugly I need
a drink? Or, I can see, reflected in your expression, my own need for alcohol?”</p>

<p>Tamir turned to Barak and said,
“Didn’t I tell you?”</p>

<p>Barak nodded and laughed, and Jacob
didn’t know what that meant, either.</p>

<p>It had been almost seven years
since Tamir’s last visit; Jacob hadn’t been to Israel since he was married.</p>

<p>Jacob had sent Tamir only good
news, much of it embellished, some of it plainly false. As it turned out, Tamir
had been doing his own share of embellishing and lying, but it would take a war
to make the truth known.</p>

<p>Hugs were exchanged all around.
Tamir lifted Irv from the ground, pushing a small fart out of him—an anal
Heimlich.</p>

<p>“I made you fart!” Tamir said,
pumping a fist.</p>

<p>“Just some gas,” Irv said—a
distinction without a difference, as Dr. Silvers would say.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make you fart again!”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Tamir wrapped his arms around Irv
again, and lifted him back into the air, this time with a firmer squeeze. And
again it worked, this time even better—applying a very specific definition of
better. Tamir put him down, took a deep breath, then opened his arms once more.</p>

<p>“This time you shit.”</p>

<p>Irv crossed his arms.</p>

<p>Tamir laughed heartily and said,
“Joking, joking!”</p>

<p>Everyone who wasn’t Irv laughed. It
was the first boisterous laugh that Jacob had heard come from Max in
weeks—maybe months.</p>

<p>Then Tamir pulled Barak forward,
mussed his hair, and said, “Look at this one. He’s a man, no?”</p>

<p>Man was exactly the right word. He
was towering, cut from Jerusalem stone and generously garnished with fur—the
kind of pecs you could bounce pocket change off, if there hadn’t been a forest
of thrice-curled hair so dense that all that entered it was deposited for good.</p>

<p>Among his brothers, and between
haircuts, Max was boy enough. But Barak made him seem small, weak, ungendered.
And everyone seemed to recognize it—no one more than Max, who took a meek half
step back, in the direction of his mommy’s room at the Washington Hilton.</p>

<p>“Max!” Tamir said, turning his
sights on the boy.</p>

<p>“Affirmative.”</p>

<p>Jacob gave an embarrassed chuckle:
“Affirmative? Really?”</p>

<p>“It just came out,” Max said,
smelling his own blood.</p>

<p>Tamir gave him a once-over and
said, “You look like a vegetarian.”</p>

<p>“Pescatarian,” Max said.</p>

<p>“You eat meat,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“I know. I look like a
pescatarian.”</p>

<p>Barak gave Max a punch to the
chest, for no obvious reason.</p>

<p>“Ouch! What the—”</p>

<p>“Joking,” Barak said, “joking.”</p>

<p>Max rubbed at his chest. “Your joke
fractured my sternum.”</p>

<p>“Food?” Tamir asked, slapping his
paunch.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe we’d head by
Isaac’s first,” Jacob suggested.</p>

<p>“Let the man eat,” Irv said,
creating sides by choosing one of them.</p>

<p>“Why the hell not,” Jacob said,
remembering that Kafka quote: “In the struggle between yourself and the world,
side with the world.”</p>

<p>Tamir looked around the airport
terminal and clapped his hands. “Panda Express! The best!”</p>

<p>He got pork lo mein. Irv did
everything he could to conceal his displeasure, but his everything wasn’t too
formidable. If Tamir couldn’t be a character in the Torah, he could at least
adhere to it. But Irv was a good host, blood being blood, and bit his tongue
until his teeth touched.</p>

<p>“You know where you can get the
best Italian food in the world right now?” Tamir asked, stabbing a piece of
pork.</p>

<p>“Italy?”</p>

<p>“Israel.”</p>

<p>“I’d heard that,” Irv said.</p>

<p>Jacob couldn’t let such a
preposterous statement go.</p>

<p>“You mean the best Italian food
outside of Italy.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m telling you the best
Italian food being cooked right now is being cooked in Israel.”</p>

<p>“Right. But you’re making the
dubious claim that Israel is the country outside of Italy that makes the best
Italian food.”</p>

<p>“Including Italy,” he said,
cracking the knuckles of his forkless hand simply by making a fist and opening
it.</p>

<p>“That’s definitionally impossible.
Like saying the best German beer is Israeli.”</p>

<p>“It’s called Goldstar.”</p>

<p>“Which I love,” Irv added.</p>

<p>“You don’t even drink beer.”</p>

<p>“But when I do.”</p>

<p>“Let me ask you something,” Tamir
said. “Where do they make the best bagels in the world?”</p>

<p>“New York.”</p>

<p>“I agree. The best bagels in the
world are being made in New York. Now let me ask you: Is a bagel a Jewish
food?”</p>

<p>“Depends on what you mean by that.”</p>

<p>“Is a bagel a Jewish food in the
same way that pasta is an Italian food?”</p>

<p>“In a similar way.”</p>

<p>“And let me also ask you: Is Israel
the Jewish homeland?”</p>

<p>“Israel is the Jewish state.”</p>

<p>Tamir straightened in his seat.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t the part of my
argument you were supposed to disagree with.”</p>

<p>Irv shot Jacob a look. “Of course
it’s the Jewish homeland.”</p>

<p>“It depends on what you mean by
homeland,” Jacob said. “If you mean ancestral homeland—”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Tamir asked.</p>

<p>“I mean the place my family comes
from.”</p>

<p>“Which is?”</p>

<p>“Galicia.”</p>

<p>“But before that.”</p>

<p>“What, Africa?”</p>

<p>Irv let his voice drip like
molasses, but not sweet: “Africa, Jacob?”</p>

<p>“It’s arbitrary. We could go back
to the trees, or the ocean, if we wanted. Some go back to Eden. You pick
Israel. I pick Galicia.”</p>

<p>“You feel Galician?”</p>

<p>“I feel American.”</p>

<p>“I feel Jewish,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“The truth,” Tamir said, popping
the last piece of pork into his mouth, “is you feel Julia’s titties.”</p>

<p>Apropos of nothing, Max asked, “Do
you think the bathroom is clean?”</p>

<p>Jacob wondered if Max’s question,
his desire to be away, was apropos of some knowledge, or intuition, that his
father hadn’t touched his mother’s breasts in months?</p>

<p>“It’s a bathroom,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“I’ll just wait until we get home.”</p>

<p>“If you have to go,” Jacob said,
“go. It’s not good to hold it.”</p>

<p>“Says who?” Irv asked.</p>

<p>“Says your prostate.”</p>

<p>“You think my prostate speaks to
you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to go,” Max said.</p>

<p>“It’s good to hold it,” Tamir said.
“It’s like a … what do you call it? Not a kugel…”</p>

<p>“Give it a shot, OK, Max? Just in
case.”</p>

<p>“Let the kid not go,” Irv said. And
to Tamir: “A kegel. And you’re absolutely right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” Jacob said. “You know
why? Because I love my prostate.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you should marry it,” Max
said.</p>

<p>Jacob didn’t have to go, but he
went. And then he stood there at the urinal, an asshole with an exposed penis,
passing a few moments to further his absence of a point, and just in case.</p>

<p>A man his father’s age was
urinating beside him. His pee came out in bursts, as if from a lawn sprinkler,
and to Jacob’s unaccredited ear it sounded like a symptom. When the man let out
a small grunt, Jacob reflexively glanced over, and they exchanged the briefest
of smiles before remembering where they were: a place where exactly one
extremely brief moment of acknowledgment was tolerable. Jacob had the strong
sensation that he knew this person. He often felt that at urinals, but this
time he was sure—as he always was. Where had he seen that face before? A
teacher from grade school? One of the boys’ teachers? One of his father’s
friends? He was momentarily convinced that this stranger was a figure in one of
Julia’s old family photos from Eastern Europe, and that he had traveled through
time to deliver a warning.</p>

<p>Jacob returned to thoughts of
babbling brooks and the slow death of a lower back whose demise, like so much
else, he never considered until forced, and it hit him: Spielberg. Once the
thought appeared, there was no doubting it. Of course it was him. Jacob was
standing, his penis exposed, next to Steven Spielberg, whose penis was exposed.
What were the odds?</p>

<p>Jacob had grown up, as had every
Jew in the last quarter of the twentieth century, under Spielberg’s wing.
Rather, in the shadow of his wing. He had seen E.T. three times in its opening
week, all at the Uptown, each time through his fingers as the bike chase
reached a climax so delicious it was literally unbearable. He had seen Indiana
Jones, and the next one, and the next one. Tried to sit through Always.
Nobody’s perfect. Not until he makes Schindler’s List, at which point he is not
even he anymore, but representative of them. Them? The murdered millions. No,
Jacob thought, representative of us. The Unmurdered. But Schindler wasn’t for
us. It was for them. Them? Not the Murdered, of course. They couldn’t watch
movies. It was for all of them who weren’t us: the goyim. Because with
Spielberg, into whose bank account the general public was compelled to make
annual deposits, we finally had a way to force them to look at our absence, to
rub their noses in the German shepherd’s shit.</p>

<p>And God, was he loved. Jacob found
the movie schmaltzy, overblown, and flirting with kitsch. But he had been
profoundly moved. Irv denounced the choice to tell an uplifting Holocaust
story, to give, for all intents and purposes, a statistically negligible happy
ending generated by that statistically negligible of species, the good German.
But even Irv had been moved to his limits. Isaac couldn’t have been more moved:
You see, you see what was done to us, to mine parents, to mine brothers, to me,
you see? Everyone was moved, and everyone was persuaded that being moved was
the ultimate aesthetic, intellectual, and ethical experience.</p>

<p>Jacob was going to have to cop a
look at Spielberg’s penis. The only question was on what pretense.</p>

<p>Every annual physical ended with
Dr. Schlesinger kneeling in front of Jacob, cupping Jacob’s balls, and asking
him to turn his head and cough. That experience seemed to be universal, and
universally inexplicable, among men. But coughing and turning one’s head had
something to do with genitals. The logic wasn’t airtight, but it felt right.
Jacob coughed and snuck a peek.</p>

<p>The size didn’t make an
impression—Spielberg was no longer, shorter, wider, or narrower than most
doughy Jewish grandfathers. Neither was he particularly bananaed, pendular,
reticulated, lightbulb-ish, reptilian, laminar, mushroomed, varicosey,
hook-nosed, or cockeyed. What was notable was what wasn’t missing: his penis
was uncircumcised. Jacob had had precious little exposure to the visual
atrocity that is an intact penis, and so wouldn’t bet his life on what he
saw—and the stakes felt that high—but he knew enough to know that he had to
look again. But though urinal etiquette forgives a greeting, and the cough
might have been a passable alibi for the glance, there was simply no way to
return to the scene without propositioning sex, and even in a world in which
Spielberg hadn’t made A.I., that wasn’t going to happen.</p>

<p>There were four options: (1) he had
misidentified him as Steven Spielberg and misidentified his penis as being
uncircumcised; (2) he had misidentified him as Steven Spielberg and correctly
identified his penis as being uncircumcised; (3) it was Steven Spielberg, but
he had misidentified his penis as being uncircumcised—of course he was
circumcised; or (4) Steven Spielberg wasn’t circumcised. If he were a betting
man, he’d push his mountain of chips onto (4).</p>

<p>Jacob flushed (his face and the
urinal), washed too quickly to accomplish anything, and scrambled back out to
the others.</p>

<p>“You’re never going to guess who I
just peed beside.”</p>

<p>“Jesus, Dad.”</p>

<p>“Close. Spielberg.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” Tamir asked.</p>

<p>“You’re serious?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Spielberg. Steven Spielberg.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of him.”</p>

<p>“Give me a break,” Jacob said, unsure,
as ever, to what extent Tamir was performing. Whatever else could be said about
him, Tamir was smart, worldly, and restless. But whatever else could be said
about him, he was foolish, solipsistic, and self-satisfied. If he had a sense
of humor, it was drier than cornstarch. Which enabled him to practice a kind of
psychological acupuncture on Jacob: Did a needle just enter me? Does it hurt?
Is this complete bullshit? He couldn’t have been serious about Israeli Italian
food, could he? About not having heard of Spielberg? Impossible, and entirely
possible.</p>

<p>“That’s heavy,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“And the heaviest part?” Jacob
leaned in and whispered, “He’s not circumcised.”</p>

<p>Max threw his hands into the air.
“What did you, kiss his wiener in a bathroom stall?”</p>

<p>“Who is this Spielberg?” Tamir
asked.</p>

<p>“We were at urinals, Max.” And just
to be clear: “And of course I didn’t kiss his wiener.”</p>

<p>“That simply cannot be right,” Irv
said.</p>

<p>“I know. But I saw it with my own
eyes.”</p>

<p>“Why were your own eyes checking
out another man’s penis?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“Because he’s Steven Spielberg.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t someone tell me who this
person is?” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t believe that you
don’t know who he is.”</p>

<p>“Why would I pretend?” Tamir asked,
entirely believably.</p>

<p>“Because it’s your bizarre Israeli
way of diminishing the achievements of American Jews.”</p>

<p>“And why would I want to do that?”</p>

<p>“You’d have to tell me.”</p>

<p>“OK,” Tamir said, calmly wiping the
remnants of six packets of duck sauce from the corners of his mouth, “whatever
you say.” He got up and headed in the direction of the condiments bar.</p>

<p>“You have to go back in and be
sure,” Irv said. “Introduce yourself.”</p>

<p>“You will do no such thing,” Max
said, exactly as his mother would have.</p>

<p>Irv closed his eyes and said, “My
core has been shaken.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“What are we to believe?”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“All the while we thought his
Holocaust schlock was compensating for the Holocaust.”</p>

<p>“Now it’s schlock?”</p>

<p>“It was always schlock,” Irv said.
“But it was our schlock. Now … I have to wonder.”</p>

<p>“It’s not as if he isn’t Jewi—”</p>

<p>But Jacob couldn’t finish the
sentence. Or he didn’t need to. As soon as the fragment of the possibility
entered the world, there was no room for anything else.</p>

<p>“I need to sit down,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“You are sitting down,” Max told
him.</p>

<p>“I need to sit on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” Jacob said. “It’s filthy.”</p>

<p>“Everything is now filthy,” Irv
said.</p>

<p>In silence, they watched dozens of
people balancing overstuffed trays weave and dodge and never touch. Presumably,
a higher life-form would have its own version of David Attenborough. That
“person” could make a great episode of a miniseries about humans featuring such
hypnotic observing.</p>

<p>Max whispered something
incomprehensible, to no one.</p>

<p>Irv rested his head in his hands
and said, “If God had wanted us to be uncircumcised, He wouldn’t have invented
smegma.”</p>

<p>“What?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“If God had wanted…”</p>

<p>“I’m talking to Max.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything,” Max said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Jaws is such a terrible movie,”
Irv said.</p>

<p>And then Tamir came back. They’d
been too preoccupied by their apocalyptic speculations to notice how long he’d
been gone.</p>

<p>“So here’s the deal,” he said.</p>

<p>“What deal?”</p>

<p>“He has problems with urinary
retention.”</p>

<p>“He?”</p>

<p>“Steve.”</p>

<p>Irv clapped his cheeks and squealed
like it was his first visit to the American Girl flagship store.</p>

<p>“I can see why you assumed I would
know who he is. Very impressive résumé. What can I say? I don’t watch a lot of
movies. There’s no money in watching movies. A lot in making them, though. Do
you know that he’s worth more than three billion dollars? Billion with a b?”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“He had no reason to lie to me.”</p>

<p>“But why did he have reason to
share?”</p>

<p>“I asked.”</p>

<p>“How much he’s worth?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“And you probably asked if he’s
circumcised, right?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>Jacob embraced Tamir. He hadn’t
meant to. His arms simply reached for him. It wasn’t that Tamir had gathered
the piece of information. It was that he had all the qualities that Jacob
lacked and didn’t want but desperately missed: the brashness, the fearlessness
where fear was not required, the fearlessness where fear was required, the
giving of no shits. “Tamir, you are a beautiful human being.”</p>

<p>“So…?” Irv begged.</p>

<p>Tamir turned to Jacob.</p>

<p>“He knows you, by the way. He
didn’t recognize you, but when I mentioned your name, he said he read your
first book. He said he considered optioning it, whatever that means.”</p>

<p>“He did?”</p>

<p>“That’s
what he said.”</p>

<p>“If
Spielberg had made a film out of that book, I’d—”</p>

<p>“Exhume
the lede,” Irv said. “Is he short-sleeved?”</p>

<p>Tamir
jiggled his soda cup, freeing the ice cubes from their group hug.</p>

<p>“Tamir?”</p>

<p>“We
agreed it would be funnier if I didn’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“We?”</p>

<p>“Steve
and I.”</p>

<p>Jacob
gave him a shove, as spontaneous as the hug.</p>

<p>“You’re
bullshitting.”</p>

<p>“Israelis
never bullshit.”</p>

<p>“Israelis
only bullshit.”</p>

<p>“We’re
mishpuchah,” Irv pleaded.</p>

<p>“Yes.
And if you can’t keep secrets from your family, who can you keep secrets from?”</p>

<p>“So I
emancipate myself from the family. Now tell me.”</p>

<p>Tamir
scraped the remaining lo mein from his bowl and said, “Before I fly back.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’ll
tell you before I go.”</p>

<p>“You
can’t be serious.”</p>

<p>Could
he be serious?</p>

<p>“I
can.”</p>

<p>Irv
banged the table.</p>

<p>“I’ll
tell Max,” Tamir said. “An early bar mitzvah present. What he chooses to do
with the information is his own business.”</p>

<p>“You
know it’s Sam’s bar mitzvah,” Max said. “Not mine.”</p>

<p>“Of
course,” he said with a wink. “This is a very early bar mitzvah present.”</p>

<p>He
put his hands on Max’s shoulders and brought him close. His lips almost
touching Max’s ear, he whispered. And Max smiled. He laughed.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>As
they walked to the car, Irv kept signaling for Jacob to take one of Tamir’s
bags, and Jacob kept signaling that Tamir wouldn’t let him. And Jacob signaled
to Max that he should talk to Barak, and Max signaled back that his father
should—smoke through a stoma? There they were, four men and one almost-man, and
yet they were making silly hand gestures that communicated almost nothing and
fooled almost no one.</p>

<p>“How’s
your grandfather?” Tamir asked.</p>

<p>“Compared
to what?”</p>

<p>“To
how he was last time I saw him.”</p>

<p>“That
was a decade ago.”</p>

<p>“So
he’s older, probably.”</p>

<p>“He’s
moving in a couple of days.”</p>

<p>“Making
aliyah?”</p>

<p>“Yup.
To the Jewish Home.”</p>

<p>“What’s
he got left?”</p>

<p>“Are
you asking me how much longer he is expected to live?”</p>

<p>“You
find such complicated ways to say such simple things.”</p>

<p>“I
can only tell you what his doctor told me.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“He’s
been dead for five years.”</p>

<p>“A
medical miracle.”</p>

<p>“Among
other kinds. I’m sure it would mean the world to him to see you.”</p>

<p>“Let’s
go to your house. We’ll drop off the bags, see Julia—”</p>

<p>“She
won’t be back until the late afternoon.”</p>

<p>“So
we’ll nosh, shoot some baskets. I’d like to see your audiovisual setup.”</p>

<p>“I
don’t think we have one. And he usually goes to sleep very early, like—”</p>

<p>“You’re
our guest,” Irv said to Tamir, patting his back. “We’ll do whatever you’d
like.”</p>

<p>“Of
course,” Jacob said, siding with the world in its struggle against his grandfather.
“We can always visit later. Or tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I
brought some halvah for him.”</p>

<p>“He’s
diabetic.”</p>

<p>“It’s
from the souk.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,
his diabetes doesn’t really care about sourcing.”</p>

<p>Tamir
took the halvah from his carry-on bag, opened the wrapping, removed a piece,
and tossed it in his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’ll
drive,” Jacob said to Irv as they approached the car.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because
I’ll drive.”</p>

<p>“I
thought the highway made you anxious?”</p>

<p>“Don’t
be ridiculous,” Jacob said, flashing Tamir a smile of dismissiveness. And then,
to Irv, with force: “Give me the keys.”</p>

<p>In
the car, Tamir pressed the sole of his right foot against the windshield,
parachuting his scrotum for any infra-red traffic cameras they might pass. He
braided his fingers behind his head—more knuckle cracking—nodded, and began:
“To tell you the truth, I’m making a lot of money.” Here we go, Jacob thought.
Tamir impersonating the bad impersonator of Tamir. “High tech has gone crazy,
and I was smart enough—I was brave enough—to get into a lot of things at the
right moment. That’s the secret to success: the combination of intelligence and
bravery. Because there are a lot of intelligent people in the world, and a lot
of brave people in the world, but when you go searching for people who are
intelligent and brave, you don’t find yourself surrounded. And I was lucky.
Look, Jake—” Why did he think it was OK to capriciously shear Jacob’s name? It
was an act of aggression, even if Jacob couldn’t parse it, even if he loved it.
“I don’t believe in luck, but only a fool wouldn’t acknowledge the importance
of being in the right place at the right time. You make your own luck. That’s
what I say.”</p>

<p>“That’s
also what everyone says,” Jacob pointed out.</p>

<p>“But
still, we don’t control everything.”</p>

<p>“What
about Israel?” Irv asked from the backseat.</p>

<p>“Israel?”
Here we go. “Israel is thriving. Walk down the streets of Tel Aviv one night.
There’s more culture per square foot than anywhere in the world. Look at our
economy. We’re sixty-eight years old—younger than you, Irv. We have only seven
million people, no natural resources, and are engaged in perpetual war. All of
that, and we have more companies on the NASDAQ than any country after America.
We have more start-ups than China, India, and the U.K., and file more patents
than any country in the world—including yours.”</p>

<p>“Things
are going well,” Irv confirmed.</p>

<p>“Things
have never been better anywhere at any time than they are in Israel right now.”</p>

<p>“The
height of the Roman Empire?” Jacob felt a need to ask.</p>

<p>“Where
are they now?”</p>

<p>“That’s
what the Romans asked of the Greeks.”</p>

<p>“We
live in a different apartment than the one you visited. We’re always moving.
It’s good business, and it’s good in the general sense, too. We’re in a triplex
now—three floors. We have seven bedrooms—”</p>

<p>“Eight,” Barak corrected.</p>

<p>“He’s right. It’s eight.” This is
performance, Jacob reminded himself, or tried to convince himself, as he felt a
jealousy surfacing. It’s a routine. He’s not making you smaller. Tamir
continued: “Eight bedrooms, even though we’re only four people now that Noam is
in the army. Two bedrooms a person. But I like the space. It’s not that we have
so many guests, although we have a lot, but I like to stretch out: a couple of
rooms for my business ventures; Rivka is insane about meditating; the kids have
air hockey, gaming systems. They have a foosball table from Germany. I have an
assistant who has nothing to do with my business ventures but just helps with
lifestyle things, and I said, ‘Go find me the best foosball table in the
world.’ And she did. She has an amazing body, and she knows how to find
anything. It’s quite amazing. You could leave this foosball table in the rain
for a year and it would be fine.”</p>

<p>“I thought it never rains in
Israel,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“It does,” Tamir said, “but you’re
right, the climate is ideal. Anyway, I rest my drinks on it, and do they ever
leave a ring? Barak?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“So when we were walking through
the new apartment—the most recent apartment—I turned to Rivka and said, ‘Eh?’
and she said, ‘What do we need with an apartment this big?’ I told her what
I’ll tell you now: The more you buy, the more you have to sell.”</p>

<p>“You should really write a book,”
Jacob said to Tamir, taking a tiny needle from his back and placing it in
Tamir’s.</p>

<p>“So should you,” Irv said, taking
that tiny needle from Tamir’s back and placing it in Jacob’s aorta.</p>

<p>“And I told her something else:
it’s always going to be rich people who have money, so you want to have what
the rich people will want to have. The more expensive something is, the more
expensive it will become.”</p>

<p>“But that’s just saying that
expensive things are expensive,” Jacob pointed out.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Jacob’s better angel
ventriloquized, “I’d love to see it someday.”</p>

<p>“You’d have to come to Israel.”</p>

<p>With a smile: “The apartment can’t
come to me?”</p>

<p>“It could, but that would be crazy.
And anyway, soon enough it will be another apartment.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I’d love to see that
one.”</p>

<p>“And the bathrooms … The bathrooms
would blow your mind. Everything made in Germany.”</p>

<p>Irv groaned.</p>

<p>“You can’t find this kind of
craftsmanship.”</p>

<p>“Apparently you can.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t find it in
America. My assistant—the personal one, with the body—found me a toilet with a
camera that recognizes who is approaching and adjusts to preset settings. Rivka
likes a cool seat. I want my ass hairs singed. Yael wants to be practically
standing when she shits. Barak faces backwards.”</p>

<p>“I don’t face backwards,” Barak
said, punching his father’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“You think I’m crazy,” Tamir said.
“You’re probably judging me, even laughing at me in your mind, but I’m the one
with a toilet that knows his name, and I’m the one with a refrigerator that
does the shopping online, and you’re the one driving a Japanese go-kart.”</p>

<p>Jacob didn’t think Tamir was crazy.
He thought his need to exhibit and press the case for his happiness was
unconvincing and sad. And sympathetic. That’s where the emotional logic broke
down. All that should have led Jacob to dislike Tamir brought him closer—not
with envy, but love. He loved Tamir’s brazen weakness. He loved his
inability—his unwillingness—to hide his ugliness. Such exposure was what Jacob
most wanted, and most withheld from himself.</p>

<p>“And what about the situation?” Irv
asked.</p>

<p>“What situation?”</p>

<p>“Safety.”</p>

<p>“What? Food safety?”</p>

<p>“The Arabs.”</p>

<p>“Which ones?”</p>

<p>“Iran. Syria. Hezbollah. Hamas. The
Islamic State. Al-Qaeda.”</p>

<p>“The Iranians aren’t Arabs. They’re
Persian.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that helps you sleep at
night.”</p>

<p>“Things could be better, things
could be worse. Beyond that, you know what I know.”</p>

<p>”I only know what’s in the papers,”
Irv said.</p>

<p>“Where do you think I get my news?”</p>

<p>“So how does it feel over there?”
Irv pressed.</p>

<p>“Would I be happier if Noam were a
DJ for the army radio station? Sure. But I feel fine. Barak, you feel fine?”</p>

<p>“I feel cool.”</p>

<p>“You think Israel’s going to bomb
Iran?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Tamir said. “What
do you think?”</p>

<p>“Do you think they should?” Jacob
asked. He wasn’t immune to the morbid curiosity, the American Jewish bloodlust
at arm’s length.</p>

<p>“Of course they should,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“If there were a way to bomb Iran
without bombing Iran, that would be good. Any other course will be bad.”</p>

<p>“So what do you think they should
do?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“He just told you,” Irv said. “He
thinks they should bomb Iran.”</p>

<p>“I think you should bomb Iran,”
Tamir told Irv.</p>

<p>“America?”</p>

<p>“That would be good, too. But I
meant you specifically. You could use some of those biological weapons you
displayed earlier.”</p>

<p>They all laughed at that,
especially Max.</p>

<p>“Seriously,” Irv pressed, “what do
you think should happen?”</p>

<p>“Seriously, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“And you’re OK with that?”</p>

<p>“Are you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not OK with it. I think we
should bomb Iran before it’s too late.”</p>

<p>To which Tamir said, “And I think
we should establish who we is before it’s too late.”</p>

<p>All Tamir wanted to talk about was
money—the average Israeli income, the size of his own easy fortune, the
unrivaled quality of life in that fingernail clipping of oppressively hot
homeland hemmed in by psychopathic enemies.</p>

<p>All Irv wanted to talk about was
the situation—when was Israel going to make us proud by making itself safe? Was
there any inside piece of information to be dangled above friends at the dining
room at the American Enterprise Institute, or whose pin might be pulled in his
blog and thrown? Wasn’t it high time we—you—did something about this or that?</p>

<p>All Jacob wanted to talk about was
living close to death: Had Tamir killed anyone? Had Noam? Did either have any
stories of fellow soldiers torturing or being tortured? What’s the worst thing
either ever saw with his own eyes?</p>

<p>The Jews Jacob grew up with adjusted
their aviator glasses with only the muscles in their faces while parsing Fugazi
lyrics while pushing in the lighters of their hand-me-down Volvo wagons. The
lighter would pop out, they’d push it back in. Nothing was ever lit. They were
miserable at sports, but great at fantasy sports. They avoided fights, but
sought arguments. They were the children and grandchildren of immigrants, of
survivors. They were defined by, and proud of, their flagrant weakness.</p>

<p>Yet they were intoxicated by
muscle. Not literal muscle—they found that suspicious, foolish, and lame. No,
they were driven wild by the muscular application of the Jewish brain:
Maccabees rolling under the bellies of armored Greek elephants to stab the soft
undersides; Mossad missions whose odds, means, and results verged on magic;
computer viruses so preternaturally complicated and smart they couldn’t not
leave Jewish fingerprints. You think you can mess with us, world? You think you
can push us around? You can. But brain beats muscle as surely as paper beats
rock, and we’re gonna learn you; we’re gonna sit at our desks and be the last
ones standing.</p>

<p>As they sought the parking lot
exit, like a marble in one of Benjy’s OCD Marble Madness creations, Jacob felt
inexplicably peaceful. Despite all that had been spilled, was the cup still
half full? Or did a crumb of Wellbutrin just lodge free from between his
brain’s teeth, offering a morsel of undigested happiness? The cup was half full
enough.</p>

<p>Despite his endless smart-ass and
legitimate and almost-honorable protestations, Sam showed up for his bar
mitzvah lessons. And despite being forced to apologize for a noncrime that he
didn’t commit, he would show up at the bimah.</p>

<p>Despite being an insufferable,
chauvinistic blowhard, Irv was ever present, and, in his own way, ever loving.</p>

<p>Despite his long history of false
promises, and despite his older son being on duty in the West Bank, Tamir
showed up. He brought his boy. They were family, and they were being family.</p>

<p>But what about Jacob? Was he there?
His mind kept leaping to the supermagnet of Mark and Julia, though not in the
ways he would have expected. He’d often imagined Julia having sex with other
men. It very nearly destroyed him, but thrilled what was spared. He didn’t want
such thoughts, but sexual fantasy wants what is not to be had. He’d imagined
Mark fucking her after their meeting at the hardware place. But now that
something had happened between them—it was entirely possible they’d already
fucked—his mind was released. It’s not that the fantasy was suddenly too
painful; it suddenly wasn’t painful enough.</p>

<p>Now, driving a car full of family,
his wife in a hotel with a man she’d at least kissed, his fantasy found the
bull’s-eye: it was the same car, but different occupants. Julia looks in the
rearview mirror and sees Benjy falling asleep in his Benjy way: his body
straight, his neck straight, his gaze directly in front of him, his eyes
closing so slowly their movement is imperceptible—only by looking away and
looking back can you register any change. The physicality of it, the fragility
evoked by witnessing such slowness, is perplexing and beautiful. She looks at
the road, she looks in the mirror, she looks at the road. Every time she looks
at Benjy in the mirror, his eyes have closed another millimeter or two. The
process of falling asleep takes ten minutes, the seconds of which have been
pulled thin to the translucency of his slowly closing eyelids. And just before
his eyes are fully closed, he releases a short puff of breath, as if blowing
out his own candle. The rest of the drive is whispering, and each pothole feels
like a moon crater, and on the moon is a photograph of a family, left by the
Apollo astronaut Charles Duke in 1972. It will remain there, unchanging, for
millions of years, outlasting not only the parents and children in the photo,
and the grandchildren of the grandchildren of the grandchildren, but human
civilization—until the dying sun consumes it. They pull up to the house, cut
the engine, unfasten their seat belts, and Mark carries Benjy inside.</p>

<p>That was his new elsewhere, where
his mind was as they arrived at the parking lot exit. Tamir reached for his
wallet, but Irv was the quicker draw.</p>

<p>“Next time’s on me,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Irv said. “Next time we’re
exiting National Airport I’ll let you pay for the parking.”</p>

<p>The gate rose, and for the first
time since they’d gotten in the car, Max spoke up: “Turn on the radio, Dad.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear that?”</p>

<p>“Hear what?”</p>

<p>“In the guy’s booth.”</p>

<p>“The cashier?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. The radio.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Something big happened.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Do I have to do everything?” Tamir
asked, turning on the radio.</p>

<p>Entering in the middle of a report,
it was impossible to understand at first what had happened, but it was clear
that Max was right about its size. NPR’s back was straight. Reports were coming
in from across the Middle East. It was early. Little was known.</p>

<p>Jacob’s mind raced to its place of
comfort: the worst possible scenario. The Israelis had launched an attack on
Iran, or the other way around. Or the Egyptians had attacked themselves. A bus
had exploded. A plane had been hijacked. Someone had sprayed bullets in a
mosque or synagogue, swung a knife in a crowded public space. A nuclear blast
had vaporized Tel Aviv. But the thing about the worst possible scenario is that
by definition it can’t be anticipated.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Other Life was happening even when
no one was present. Just like Life. Sam was in the Model UN’s General
Assembly—at that moment, his mom passed him a note: “I can see over the wall.
Can you?”—but the ruins of his first synagogue were shimmering beside the
foundation of his second synagogue. Scattered among the rubble were the
fragments of his stained-glass Jewish Present, each shard illuminated by
destruction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>REAL REAL</h2>

<p>The Hilton’s International Ballroom
was arranged in concentric arcs of tables and chairs to resemble the UN General
Assembly. Delegations were dressed in regional garb, and some of the students
attempted accents before one of the facilitators called a moratorium on that
very bad idea.</p>

<p>The Saudi delegation’s speech was
wrapping up. A young, heavily naturally accented Hispanic girl in a hijab spoke
with quivering hands and a weak, trembling voice. Julia hated to see nervous
children. She wanted to go to her, give her an inspirational talk—explain that
life changes, and what is weak becomes strong, and what is a dream becomes a
reality that requires a new dream.</p>

<p>“And so it is our hope,” the girl
said, clearly grateful to be reaching the end, “that the Federated States of
Micronesia comes to its senses and behaves judiciously and with speed to turn
over the bomb to the International Atomic Energy Agency. That is all. Thank
you. As-salamu alaykum.”</p>

<p>There was some light applause, most
of it from Julia. At the front of the room, the chairman—a facilitator with a
goatee on his face and a Velcro wallet in his back pocket—spoke.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Saudi Arabia. And now
we’ll hear from the Federated States of Micronesia.”</p>

<p>All attention shifted to the
Georgetown Day delegation. Billie rose.</p>

<p>“Kind of ironic,” she began,
asserting her nonchalant dominance by pretending to sort through her papers as
she spoke, “for the Saudi delegate to tell us what to do, when it’s illegal for
her to swim in her own country. Just saying.”</p>

<p>Kids laughed. The Saudi delegation
shriveled. With affected drama, Billie leveled the pages against the desk and
continued.</p>

<p>“Fellow members of the United
Nations, on behalf of the Federated States of Micronesia, I would like to
address what has become known as the nuclear crisis. The Merriam-Webster
dictionary defines crisis as”—she swiped her phone into consciousness and
read—“‘a difficult or dangerous situation that needs serious attention.’ This
is not a crisis. There is nothing difficult or dangerous about our situation.
What we have here, in fact, is an opportunity, which Merriam-Webster defines as
… just one second…”—the Wi-Fi was crappy, and it took her longer than planned
to load the bookmarked page—“Here we go: ‘an amount of time or a situation in
which something can be done.’ We didn’t choose our fate, but we don’t intend to
shrink from it. For years, for millennia—or for centuries, anyway—the good
people of Micronesia accepted things as they were, understanding our diminished
existence as our lot, our burden, our fate.”</p>

<p>Julia and Sam sat at opposite ends
of the delegation. As Julia drew a brick wall on a yellow pad, she replayed the
morning’s phone call with Jacob: her lot, her burden, her fate. Why did she
feel a need to do it right then, like that? Not only had she shot from the hip
when she should have spoken from the heart or at least held her tongue, she had
risked Max and Irv getting caught in the crossfire. What did they hear and
understand? What did Jacob have to explain, and how did he do it? Were any of
the three going to mention the call to Tamir and Barak? Was that the whole
point? Did she want it all to blow up? Her wall now covered three-quarters of
the page. Perhaps a thousand bricks.</p>

<p>Billie continued: “Things are about
to change, fellow delegates. Micronesia is saying enough. Enough being pushed
around, enough subservience, enough eating scraps. Fellow delegates, things are
about to change, beginning, but most certainly not ending, with the following
list of demands…”</p>

<p>In the remaining space, between the
top of the brick wall and the edge of the page, Julia wrote, “I can see over
the wall. Can you?” She folded it in half, and folded that in half, and had it
passed the length of the delegation. Sam showed no emotion of any kind as he
read it. He wrote something on the same page, folded and refolded it, and had
it passed back to his mom. She opened it, and at first couldn’t see anything
he’d written. Nothing in the space above the wall, where she’d written. She
searched the bricks themselves—nothing. She looked to him. He put his open hand
in front of him, fingers spread, then flipped it palm-up. She turned over the
yellow paper, and Sam had written: “The other side of the wall is no wall.”</p>

<p>As the rest of the delegation was
struggling to catch up with her radical departure from the agreed-upon script,
Billie was smashing the rhetorical ceiling: “Micronesia shall, henceforth, have
a seat on the UN Security Council; be granted NATO membership—yes, we realize
we are in the Pacific—and preferential trading status with EU, NAFTA, UNASUR,
AU, and EAEC partners; have an appointed member on the Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee—”</p>

<p>A facilitator ran into the room.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to interrupt the
proceedings,” he said, “but I have an announcement. There was just a major
earthquake in the Middle East.”</p>

<p>“This is real?” one of the
chaperones asked.</p>

<p>“Real.”</p>

<p>“How major?”</p>

<p>“They’re calling it historic.”</p>

<p>“But real like the nuclear crisis?
Or real real?”</p>

<p>Julia’s phone vibrated with a call;
it was Deborah. She shuffled to the corner and answered, while the model crisis
gave way to the real real one.</p>

<p>“Deborah?”</p>

<p>“Hi, Julia.”</p>

<p>“Is everything OK?”</p>

<p>“Benjy’s fine.”</p>

<p>“I got scared when I saw your name
come up.”</p>

<p>“He’s fine. He’s watching a movie.”</p>

<p>“OK. I got scared.”</p>

<p>“Julia.” She took a long breath, to
extend the period of not-knowing. “Something horrible has happened, Julia.”</p>

<p>“Benjy?”</p>

<p>“Benjy is absolutely fine.”</p>

<p>“You’re a mother. You would tell
me.”</p>

<p>“Of course I would. He’s fine,
Julia. He’s happy.”</p>

<p>“Let me speak with him.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t about Benjy.”</p>

<p>“Oh my God, did something happen to
Jacob and Max?”</p>

<p>“No. They’re fine.”</p>

<p>“Do you promise me?”</p>

<p>“You need to go home.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>VEY IZ MIR</h2>

<p>Little was known, which made what
little was known terrifying. An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 had struck at 6:23
in the evening, its epicenter deep under the Dead Sea, just outside the Israeli
settlement of Kalya. Electricity was out in virtually all of Israel, Jordan,
Lebanon, and Syria. It seemed that the most badly damaged areas were Salt and
Amman in Jordan, as well as the West Bank city of Jericho, whose walls crumbled
thirty-four hundred years before, many archaeologists have argued, not from
Joshua’s trumpeting but from a massive earthquake.</p>

<p>First accounts were coming in from
the Old City of Jerusalem: the Crusader-era Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the
traditional burial place of Jesus and the holiest site in Christianity, which
was badly damaged in a 1927 earthquake, had partially collapsed with an unknown
number of tourists and clergymen inside. Synagogues and yeshivas, monasteries,
mosques and madrassas, were in ruins. There was no news about the Temple Mount,
either because there was no news or because those bearing it withheld it.</p>

<p>A civil engineer was being
interviewed on NPR. The host, a sultry-voiced, probably short-and-bald Jew
named Robert Siegel, began:</p>

<p>SIEGEL: We apologize, in advance,
for the audio quality of this interview. Normally, when phone lines are down,
we use cell phones. But cell service has been disabled as well, so Mr. Horowitz
is speaking to us by satellite phone. Mr. Horowitz, are you there?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Yes, hello. I am here.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Can you give us your
professional assessment of what’s going on right now?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: My professional
assessment, yes, but I can also tell you as a human being standing here that
Israel has endured a cataclysmic earthquake. Everywhere you look there is
destruction.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: You are safe, though?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Safe is a relative term.
My family is alive, and as you can hear, so am I. Some are safer. Some are less
safe.</p>

<p>Why the fuck can’t Israelis just
answer questions? Jacob wondered. Even then, in the midst of cataclysm—the word
itself sounded like classic Israeli hyperbole—the Israeli couldn’t just give a
straightforward, un-Israeli response.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Mr. Horowitz, you are an
engineer for Israeli civil services, is that correct?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: An engineer, an adviser
on government projects, an academic …</p>

<p>SIEGEL: As an engineer, what can
you tell us about the potential effects of an earthquake of this magnitude?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: It is not good.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Could you elaborate?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Of the six hundred fifty
thousand structures in Israel, fewer than half are equipped to deal with such
an event.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Are we going to see
skyscrapers topple?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Of course not, Robert
Siegel. They have been engineered to withstand even more than this. It’s the
buildings between three and eight stories I’m most worried about. Many will survive,
but few will be habitable. You have to realize that Israel didn’t have a
building code until the late 1970s, and it’s never been enforced.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Why is that?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: We’ve had other things on
our minds.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: The conflict.</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Conflict? We should have
been so lucky to have only one conflict. Most buildings are made of
concrete—very rigid, unforgiving engineering. Buildings like Israelis, you
might say. It’s served a booming population well, but couldn’t be worse-suited
to the current situation.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: What about the West Bank?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: What about it?</p>

<p>SIEGEL: How will its structures
respond to such an earthquake?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: You’d have to ask a
Palestinian civil engineer.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Well, we’ll certainly try
to—</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: But since you’re asking
me, I have to imagine it has been completely destroyed.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: I’m sorry, what has?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: The West Bank.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Destroyed?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: All of the structures.
Everything. There’s going to be a lot of fatality.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: In the thousands?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: I’m afraid that as I
speak these words, tens of thousands are already dead.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: And I am sure you want to
get to your family, but before letting you go, could you offer some
possibilities for how this will play out?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: What time frame are you
asking about? Hours? Weeks? A generation?</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Let’s start with hours.</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: The next few hours will
be pivotal for Israel. It’s all about prioritizing now. Electricity is out
countrywide, and will likely remain out, even in the major cities, for several
days. As you can imagine, military needs will be the first priority.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: I’m surprised to hear you
say that.</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: You are Jewish?</p>

<p>SIEGEL: I’m not sure why that’s
relevant, but yes, I am.</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: I’m surprised that a
fellow Jew would be surprised. But then, only an American Jew would question
why being Jewish is relevant.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: You’re concerned for
Israel’s safety?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: You aren’t?</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Mr. Horowitz—</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Israel’s tactical
superiority is technological, and that has been greatly diminished by the
quake. The destruction will cause desperation and unrest. And this will
develop—either organically or deliberately—into violence. If it hasn’t already
happened, we’re soon to see masses of people flooding the borders into Israel—from
the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria. I don’t have to tell you that
Syria already has a refugee problem.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Why would they come to
Israel, a country most in the Arab world view as a mortal enemy?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Because their mortal
enemy has first-rate medical care. Their mortal enemy has food and water. And
Israel is going to be presented with a choice: let them in, or don’t. Letting
them in will require sharing limited and precious resourses. For others to
live, Israelis will have to die. But not letting them in will involve bullets.
And of course Israel’s neighbors will have a choice, too: take care of their
citizens, or take advantage of Israel’s sudden vulnerability.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Let’s hope the shared
tragedy brings the region together.</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Yes, but let’s not be
naïve while we hope.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: And what about the long
term? You mentioned the generational view?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Of course, no one can
know what will happen, but what Israel is facing here is something far more
threatening than ’67, or ’73, or even Iran’s nuclear threat. There is the
immediate crisis of needing to secure the country, rescue citizens, get food
and medical care to those who need it, repair the electricity, gas, water, and
other utilities quickly and safely. Then there is also the work of rebuilding
the country. This will be a generational challenge. And finally, and perhaps
most daunting, will be the work of keeping Jews here.</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Meaning?</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: A young, ambitious,
idealistic Israeli has many reasons to leave Israel. You have an expression,
“The straw that broke the camel’s back.”</p>

<p>SIEGEL: Yes.</p>

<p>HOROWITZ: Thousands of buildings
have fallen on the back.</p>

<p>JACOB: Vey iz mir.</p>

<p>Jacob hadn’t meant to say anything,
and he certainly hadn’t meant to say vey iz mir. But then, no one ever means to
say vey iz mir.</p>

<p>“This is bad,” Irv said, shaking
his head. “Really, really bad in about a million ways.”</p>

<p>Jacob’s mind teleported to
apocalyptic tableaux: the ceiling collapsed onto the trundle in Tamir’s old
bedroom; women in wigs trapped under slabs of Jerusalem stone, the ruins of the
ruins of Masada. He imagined the marble bench in Blumenberg Park, now shattered
stone. It must be a catastrophe, he thought, but he meant it in two entirely
different ways: that it certainly had to be, and that he wanted it to be. He
couldn’t acknowledge the second meaning, but he couldn’t deny it.</p>

<p>Tamir said, “It’s not good. But
it’s not so bad.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to call home?”</p>

<p>“You heard him. The lines are
knocked out. And my voice won’t help anyone.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“They’re fine. Absolutely. We live
in a new construction. Like he said, it’s engineered for this kind of
thing—better than any of your skyscrapers, believe me. The building has a
backup generator—two, I think—and in the bomb shelter there’s enough food for
months. The shelter is nicer than that apartment you had in Foggy Bottom.
Remember that?”</p>

<p>Jacob remembered the apartment; he
had lived there for five years. But even more clearly he remembered the bomb
shelter in Tamir’s childhood home, despite having been inside it for less than
five minutes. It was the last day of that first trip to Israel. Deborah and
Tamir’s mother, Adina, were on a walk to the market, hoping to find some
delicacies to bring back for Isaac. Over coffee, with what almost looked like a
grin, Irv asked Shlomo if the house had a shelter.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Shlomo said, “it’s the
law.”</p>

<p>“Underneath the house?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>The second of course made clear
what should have been clear to Irv with it’s the law: Shlomo wanted his shelter
underground when there was bombing, and underground when there wasn’t. But Irv
pushed: “Would you show it to us? I’d like Jacob to see.” The I’d like Jacob to
see made clear what should have been clear to Shlomo with Underneath the
house?: Irv wasn’t going to let it go.</p>

<p>Save for the twelve-inch-thick
door, the room was slow to reveal its oddness. It was moist, the concrete floor
sweating. The light was chalky, in color and texture. Sound seemed to gather in
clouds above them. There were four gas masks hanging on the wall, even though
there were only three people in Tamir’s family. Some sort of four-for-three
promotion? Was one for the cleaning lady, or a future child? For Elijah? What
would be the protocol if chemical war broke out while Jacob’s family was there?
Was it like on a plane—adults instructed to care for themselves before
attending to their kids? Would Jacob watch himself suffocate in the reflection
of his father’s mask? His mother would never allow it. But then, she might be
suffocating, too. Surely his dad would give it to her, right? Unless she was
wearing Tamir’s mask, in which case that wouldn’t be an issue. Were adults
instructed to care for themselves before attending to their own children, or
all children? If the cleaning lady were there, would she really claim one of
the masks from Jacob’s parents? Tamir was older than Jacob by a few months. Did
that make him, relatively speaking, the adult of the two? There was no scenario
in which Jacob wouldn’t be a victim of chemical warfare.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this dump,” Tamir
said to Jacob.</p>

<p>Jacob didn’t want to go. He wanted
to spend his remaining time in Israel exploring every inch of the room,
learning it, learning himself in it, simply being there. He wanted to eat lunch
down there, bring down his clothes and suitcase and pack, forgo the last drips
of sightseeing in order to spend another couple of hours behind those
impenetrable walls. And more: he wanted to hear the air-raid siren—not the
false alarm for Yom HaShoah, but a siren signaling a complete destruction from
which he would be safe.</p>

<p>“Come on,” Tamir said, pulling on
Jacob’s arm with awkward force.</p>

<p>On the flight back to America,
thirty-three thousand feet above the Atlantic, Jacob dreamed of a shelter
beneath the shelter, reached by another set of stairs. But this second shelter
was enormous, large enough to be confused for the world, large enough to hold
enough people to make war inevitable. And when the bombs started to fall in the
world on that side of the thick door, the world on the other side became the
shelter.</p>

<p>Nearly ten years later, Tamir and
Jacob split a six-pack at a kitchen table that couldn’t be walked around, in an
apartment carved out of an apartment, carved out of a house in Foggy Bottom. “I
met someone,” Jacob said, saying it aloud for the first time.</p>

<p>And nearly twenty years after that,
in a Japanese car bisecting the nation’s capital, the Israeli cousin—Jacob’s
Israeli cousin—said, “Anyway, it’s not going to come to that.”</p>

<p>“To what?”</p>

<p>“To bomb shelters. To war.”</p>

<p>“Who said war?”</p>

<p>“We’ll figure it out,” Tamir said,
as if to himself. “Israel is Hebrew for ‘contingency plan.’”</p>

<p>They drove the next few minutes
without speaking. NPR did its best with unreliable news, and Tamir buried
himself in his phone, which might have been a tablet, or even a TV. Despite checking
his own with manic constancy, Jacob hated all phones—found them to be even
worse than the brain tumors they gave their users. Why? Because he hated that
his was ruining his life? Or because he knew that it wasn’t ruining his life,
but gave him the easy and socially acceptable means to ruin it himself? Or
because he suspected that other people were getting more, and more interesting,
messages? Or maybe he knew all along that his phone would be his undoing—even
if he didn’t know how.</p>

<p>Tamir’s phone was singularly
annoying. Barak’s, too. They were phone SUVs. Jacob didn’t care how vivid their
screens were, or how good the reception, or how easy to link with their other
miserable devices. Barak had never even been to America, which, if it wasn’t
the greatest country in the history of the world, at the very least had a few
things to offer eyes that cared to look up. Maybe they were searching for news,
although what kind of news site emits “Boom shakalaka!” every few seconds?</p>

<p>“What about Noam?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“This moment?” Tamir said. “As we
speak? I have no idea. Keeping fathers informed is not of national importance.”</p>

<p>“When you last spoke with him?”</p>

<p>“Hebron. But I’m sure they were
evacuated.”</p>

<p>“By helicopter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Jacob. How would I
know?”</p>

<p>“And Yael?”</p>

<p>“She’s fine. She’s in Auschwitz.”</p>

<p>Boom shakalaka!</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“School trip.”</p>

<p>They drove the George Washington
Parkway in silence, AC battling the humidity that seeped through the invisible
points of entry, small talk between Jacob and Irv battling the awkward silence
that pressed against the windows—past Gravelly Point, where aviation buffs
holding radio scanners, and fathers holding sons, could almost reach up and
touch the landing gears of jumbo jets; the Capitol on the right, across the
brown Potomac; the inevitable explanation of why the Washington Monument
changes shades of white one-third of the way up. They crossed Memorial Bridge,
between the golden horses, circled around the backside of the Lincoln Memorial,
the steps that seemed to lead to nothing, and slid into the flow of Rock Creek
Parkway. After passing under the terrace of the Kennedy Center and beside the
teeth of the Watergate balconies, they followed the curves of the creek away
from the outposts of the capital’s civilization.</p>

<p>“The zoo,” Tamir said, looking up
from his phone.</p>

<p>“The zoo,” Jacob echoed.</p>

<p>Irv leaned forward: “You know, our
favorite primates, Benjy and Deborah, are probably there right now.”</p>

<p>The zoo was at the epicenter of
Tamir and Jacob’s friendship, their familialship; it marked the threshold
between their youth and adulthood. And it was at the epicenter of Jacob’s life.
Jacob’s mind often traveled to his own deathbed scene, especially when he felt
that he was wasting his life. What moments, in his final moments, would he
return to? He would remember arriving at the inn with Julia—both times. He
would remember carrying Sam into the house after the ER, the tiny hand
mummified in layers and layers of bandaging, cartoonishly large: the biggest,
most useless fist in the world. He would remember the night at the zoo.</p>

<p>He wondered if Tamir ever thought
about it, if he was thinking about it then.</p>

<p>And then Tamir let out a deep,
subterranean laugh.</p>

<p>“What’s funny?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“Me. This feeling.”</p>

<p>“What feeling?”</p>

<p>He laughed again—his greatest
performance yet?</p>

<p>“Jealousy.”</p>

<p>“Jealousy? That’s not what I was
expecting you to say.”</p>

<p>“It’s not what I was expecting to
feel. That’s why it’s funny.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Noam will finally have better
stories than me. I’m jealous. But it’s good. It’s as it should be.”</p>

<p>“As it should be?”</p>

<p>“Having better stories.”</p>

<p>Irv said, “Maybe you should call?”</p>

<p>Jacob said, “‘Once upon a time
there was a man whose life was so good there’s no story to tell about it.’”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” Tamir said, punching a
long string of numbers. “It’s not going to work, but for your sake, Irv, I’ll
try.” After a few moments, an automated Hebrew message filled the car. Tamir
hung up and, this time without Irv’s prompting, tried calling again. He listened.
They all listened.</p>

<p>“Circuits busy.”</p>

<p>Vey iz mir.</p>

<p>“Try again in a minute?”</p>

<p>“No reason.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to be alarmist,”
Jacob said, “but do you need to go home?”</p>

<p>Boom shakalaka!</p>

<p>“And how would I do that?”</p>

<p>“We could drive back to the airport
and check on flights,” Jacob offered.</p>

<p>“All flights in and out of Israel
are canceled.”</p>

<p>Vey iz mir.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>Tamir held up his phone and said,
“You think I’m playing games?”</p>

<p>Boom shakalaka!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE SECOND SYNAGOGUE</h2>

<p>No synagogue is sentient, but just
as Sam believed that all things are capable of longing, so did he believe that
all things have some awareness of their imminent end: he would tell fires “It’s
OK” as the last embers hummed, and apologize to the three-hundred-million-odd
sperm before flushing them on their way to wastewater treatment. No synagogue
isn’t sentient.</p>

<p>When Sam got home from Model UN, he
went straight into Other Life, like a smoker racing to get outside Sydney
Airport. His iPad awoke with a memo on the screen: Max’s explanation of
Samanta’s death, their father’s guilt (as in, culpability), and his own
profound guilt (as in, the feeling of culpability). Sam read it twice—for
clarification, and to defer the confrontation with reality.</p>

<p>His failure to spaz upon learning
that Max wasn’t playing a sick joke surprised him. Why wasn’t he breaking his
iPad over his bedpost, or screaming things that couldn’t be taken back at
someone who didn’t deserve them, or at least crying? He wasn’t in any way
indifferent to Samanta’s death, and he certainly hadn’t reached some epiphany
that it was “only a game.” It wasn’t only a game. What awareness did Samanta
have of her imminent end? No avatar isn’t sentient.</p>

<p>Every Skype session with his
great-grandfather began with “I see you” and ended with “See you.” Sam was
bothered by the knowledge that one such conversation would be their last, and
that there ought to, at some point, be some acknowledgment of some version of
that fact. They had skyped early the previous morning, as Sam hastily packed
for Model UN—Isaac awoke before the sun rose, and went to bed before it set.
They never talked for more than five minutes—despite having had it explained to
him a hundred times that skyping doesn’t cost anything ever, Isaac refused to
believe that longer conversations didn’t cost more—and this one had been
particularly brief. Sam shared the vaguest description of the upcoming school
trip, confirmed that he wasn’t sick or hungry and that no, he wasn’t “seeing
anyone.”</p>

<p>“And everything is ready for your
bar mitzvah?”</p>

<p>“Pretty much.”</p>

<p>But as he was about to click
off—“Mom is waiting for me downstairs, so I should probably go”—Sam felt the
expected discomfort, only this time with an urgency, or longing. He wasn’t sure
the longing was his.</p>

<p>“Go,” Isaac said. “Go. We’ve
already been on for too long.”</p>

<p>“I just wanted you to know that I
love you.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know, sure. And I love
you. OK, now go.”</p>

<p>“And I’m sorry that you’re moving.”</p>

<p>“Go, Sameleh.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you can’t just
stay.”</p>

<p>“Because I can’t take care of
myself anymore.”</p>

<p>“I mean here.”</p>

<p>“Sameleh.”</p>

<p>“What? I don’t get it.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t go up and down the
stairs.”</p>

<p>“So we’d get one of those chairlift
things.”</p>

<p>“They’re very expensive.”</p>

<p>“I’ll use my bar mitzvah money.”</p>

<p>“I have lots of medicines I need to
take.”</p>

<p>“I have lots of vitamins I need to
take. Mom is great with things like that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to make you upset,
but soon I won’t be able to take baths or go to the toilet on my own.”</p>

<p>“Benjy can’t take baths on his own,
and we’re constantly cleaning up Argus poop.”</p>

<p>“I am not a child, and I am not a
dog.”</p>

<p>“I know, I’m just say—”</p>

<p>“I take care of my family,
Sameleh.”</p>

<p>“You take such good care, but—”</p>

<p>“My family doesn’t take care of
me.”</p>

<p>“I understand, but—”</p>

<p>“And that is that.”</p>

<p>“I’m gonna ask Dad—”</p>

<p>“No,” Isaac said, with a sternness
Sam had never heard.</p>

<p>“Why not? I’m sure he’ll say yes.”</p>

<p>There was a long pause. If it
weren’t for Isaac’s blinking eyes, Sam would have wondered if the image had frozen.
“I told you no,” Isaac finally said, severely.</p>

<p>The connection weakened, the pixels
enlarged.</p>

<p>What had Sam done? Something wrong,
something unkind, but what?</p>

<p>Tentatively, in an effort to
compensate for whatever hurt he’d accidentally inflicted in his effort to love,
he said, “Also, I have a girlfriend.”</p>

<p>“Jewish?” Isaac asked, his face
only a handful of pixels.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Sam lied.</p>

<p>“I see you,” Isaac said, and
clicked off.</p>

<p>The addition of the I, the only
letter that takes up less space than a space, changed everything. The longing
was his great-grandfather’s.</p>

<p>Sam’s second synagogue was as he’d
left it. He had no avatar with which to explore, so he quickly and crudely made
a blocky figure to drop in. The foundation had been poured and the walls were
framed, but without the drywall he could have shot an arrow, or his gaze, all
the way through it. He—Sam knew that his new avatar was a man—went to one of
the walls, gripped the studs like prison bars, and pushed it over. Sam was at
once controlling this and witnessing it. He went to another wall and pushed it
over.</p>

<p>Sam wasn’t destroying, and he
wasn’t Sam. He was carving a space out of a larger space. He didn’t yet know
who he was.</p>

<p>The exuberantly branching edifice
was shrinking toward its center, like a failing empire that pulls its army back
to the capital, like the blackening fingers of a stranded climber. No more
social hall, no more basketball court or changing rooms, no more children’s
library, no more classrooms, no more offices for any administrator or cantor or
rabbi, no more chapel, no more sanctuary.</p>

<p>What remained after all those walls
came down?</p>

<p>Half a dozen rooms.</p>

<p>Sam hadn’t intended this
configuration, he’d merely created it. And he wasn’t Sam.</p>

<p>A dining room, a living room, a
kitchen. A hall. A bathroom, a guest bedroom, a TV room, a bedroom.</p>

<p>Something was missing. It was
longing for something.</p>

<p>He went to the ruins of the first
synagogue and took the largely intact window of Moses floating down the Nile,
as well as a handful of rubble. He replaced one of the kitchen windows with the
Moses window and put the rubble in the fridge, among the ginger ale.</p>

<p>But something was still missing.
There was still a longing.</p>

<p>A basement. It needed a basement.
The sentient synagogue, aware that even as it was being constructed it was
being destroyed, longed for an underground. He had no money to buy a shovel, so
he used his hands. He dug it like a grave. He dug until he wouldn’t have been
able to feel the arms that he couldn’t feel. He dug until a family could have
hidden behind the displaced earth.</p>

<p>And then he stood inside his work,
like a cave painter inside his painting of a cave.</p>

<p>I see you.</p>

<p>Sam gave himself white hair,
restored Firefox to the desktop, and googled: How is bubble wrap made?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE EARTHQUAKE</h2>

<p>When they got to the house, Julia
was on the stoop, her arms holding her bent knees to her chest. The sun settled
on her hair like yellow chalk dust, shaking free with the tiniest movement.
Seeing her there, as she was then, in that moment, Jacob spontaneously shook
free the resentment that had settled in his heart like gravel. She wasn’t his
wife, not right then, she was the woman he married—a person rather than a
dynamic.</p>

<p>As he approached, Julia gave a weak
smile, the smile of resignation. That morning, before leaving for the airport,
he’d read a National Geographic sidebar about a broken weather satellite that
could no longer do whatever it had been created to do, but would, because of
the great expense and limited need to capture it, orbit the planet doing
nothing until it ultimately fell to Earth. Her smile was remote like that.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” Jacob
asked. “I thought you weren’t going to be home until later.”</p>

<p>“We decided to come back a couple
of hours early.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Sam?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“Is that something you can decide?
As the chaperone?”</p>

<p>“If Mark runs into a problem, I can
be there in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>Jacob hated hearing that fucking
name. He felt his heart refilling with gravel and sinking.</p>

<p>“Sam’s upstairs,” Julia told Max.</p>

<p>“I suppose you can follow me,” Max
said to Barak, and the two went inside.</p>

<p>“I’m going to defecate,” Irv said,
shuffling past, “and then I’ll rejoin the party. Hey, Julia.”</p>

<p>Tamir emerged from the car and
extended his arms.</p>

<p>“Julie!”</p>

<p>No one called her Julie. Not even
Tamir called her Julie.</p>

<p>“Tamir!”</p>

<p>He embraced her in one of his hug
dramas: holding her at arm’s length, looking her up and down, then bringing her
back into his body, then holding her at arm’s length for another examination.</p>

<p>“Everyone else gets older,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I’m not getting any younger,” she
said, unwilling to return his flirtation, but unwilling to smother it, either.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say you were.”</p>

<p>They exchanged a smile.</p>

<p>Jacob wanted to hate Tamir for
sexualizing everything, but he wasn’t sure if the habit resulted from free
choice or environmental conditioning—how much of Tamir’s way was simply the
Israeli way, cultural misinterpretation. And maybe desexualizing everything was
Jacob’s own way, even when he was sexualizing everything.</p>

<p>“We’re so happy to have you for the
extra time,” Julia said.</p>

<p>Why was no one mentioning the
earthquake, Jacob wondered. Was Julia afraid that they hadn’t heard about it
yet? Did she want to present the news in a thoughtful and controlled way, free
of potential interruptions? Or had she not yet heard about it? More puzzling,
why wasn’t Tamir, he who mentioned everything, mentioning it?</p>

<p>“It’s not an easy trip,” Tamir
said. “I would say you know, but you don’t. Anyway, I thought we’d come a
little early and make the most of it—let Barak get to know his American
family.”</p>

<p>“And Rivka?”</p>

<p>“She sends her regrets. She very
much wanted to come.”</p>

<p>“Everything’s OK?”</p>

<p>Jacob was surprised by her
forthrightness and reminded of his own restraint.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Tamir said. “Just some
old obligations she couldn’t rearrange. Now: Jake mentioned you’d prepared some
food?”</p>

<p>“Did he?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t. I didn’t even think you
were going to be back until later in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t lie to your wife,” Tamir
said, giving Jacob a wink that Jacob wasn’t positive Julia saw, so he told her,
“He winked at me.”</p>

<p>“Let’s put some food together,”
Julia said. “Head in. Max will show you where to put your things down, and
we’ll catch up around the kitchen table.”</p>

<p>As Tamir entered the house, Julia
took Jacob’s hand. “Can we talk for a second?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“They’re driving me crazy.”</p>

<p>“I need to tell you something.”</p>

<p>“Something else?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Years later, Jacob would remember
this moment as a vast hinge.</p>

<p>“Something’s happened,” she said.</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Mark.”</p>

<p>“No,” Julia said, “not that. Not
me.”</p>

<p>And then, with a great flush of
relief, Jacob said, “Oh, right. We already heard.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“On the radio.”</p>

<p>“The radio?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, it sounds horrible. And
really scary.”</p>

<p>“What does?”</p>

<p>“The earthquake.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Julia said, at once clear and
confused. “The earthquake. Yes.”</p>

<p>It was then that Jacob realized
they were still holding hands.</p>

<p>“Wait, what were you talking
about?”</p>

<p>“Jacob—”</p>

<p>“Mark.”</p>

<p>“No, not that.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking about it on the
drive over. I was thinking about everything. After we got off the phone, I—”</p>

<p>“Stop. Please.”</p>

<p>He felt the blood rush to his face
like a tide, then recede as quickly. He’d done something horrible, but he
didn’t know what. It wasn’t the phone. There was nothing more to learn there.
The money he’d taken out of ATMs over the years? For stupid, harmless things he
was embarrassed to admit wanting? What? Had she somehow looked through his
e-mails? Seen how he spoke about her to those who might understand or at least
sympathize? Had he been stupid enough, or forced by his subconscious, to leave
himself signed in on some device?</p>

<p>He put his hand on top of her hand
on top of his hand: “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“It’s not your fault.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry, Julia.”</p>

<p>He was sorry, so sorry, but for
what? There was so much to apologize for.</p>

<p>At his wedding, Jacob’s mother told
a story that he had no memory of, and didn’t believe was true, and was hurt by,
because even if it wasn’t true, it could have been, and it exposed him.</p>

<p>“You were probably expecting my
husband,” Deborah began, eliciting a good laugh. “Perhaps you’ve noticed that
he usually does the talking. And talking.”</p>

<p>More laughter.</p>

<p>“But this one I wanted. The wedding
of my son, whom I grew in my body, and fed from my body, and gave everything of
myself so that one day he would be able to let go of my hand and take the hand
of another. To his credit, my husband didn’t argue or complain. He just gave me
the silent treatment for three weeks.” More laughter, especially from Irv.
“They were the happiest three weeks of my life.”</p>

<p>More laughter.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget our honeymoon!” Irv
called.</p>

<p>“Did we go on a honeymoon?” Deborah
asked.</p>

<p>More laughter.</p>

<p>“You might have noticed that Jews
don’t exchange wedding vows. The covenant is said to be implicit in the ritual.
Isn’t that wonderfully Jewish? To stand before one’s life partner, and before
one’s god, at what is probably the most significant moment of your life, and to
assume it goes without saying? It’s hard to think of anything else that a Jew
would assume goes without saying.”</p>

<p>More laughter.</p>

<p>“I’ll never get over what a strange
and easily explained people we are. But perhaps some of you are like me, and
cannot help but hear the familiar vows: ‘for richer, for poorer, in sickness
and in health.’ They might not be our words, but they are in our collective
subconscious.</p>

<p>“There was a year in Jacob’s
childhood—” She looked to Irv and said, “Maybe it was even more than a year? A
year and a half?” Then she looked back to those gathered. “There was a period
of time that felt like longer than it was”—laughter—“when Jacob would pretend
he was disabled. It started with the announcement, one morning, that he was blind.
‘But you’re closing your eyes,’ I told him.”</p>

<p>More laughter.</p>

<p>“‘That’s only because there’s
nothing to look at,’ he said, ‘so I’m resting them.’ Jacob was a stubborn
child. He could keep up a resistance for days, and weeks. Irv, can you imagine
from where he might have gotten that?”</p>

<p>A laugh.</p>

<p>Irv called back, “Nature from me,
nurture from you!”</p>

<p>Another laugh.</p>

<p>Deborah continued: “He stuck with
the blindness for three or four days—a long time for a child, or anyone, to
keep his eyes closed—but then came to dinner one night batting lashes and once
again adept with silverware. ‘I’m happy to see you’ve recovered,’ I said. He
shrugged his shoulders and pointed to his ears. ‘What is it, love?’ He went to
the cabinet, got a pen and paper, and wrote, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t hear you. I’m
deaf.’ Irv said, ‘You aren’t deaf.’ Jacob mouthed the words ‘I am deaf.’</p>

<p>“Maybe a month later, he limped
into the living room with a pillow under the back of his shirt. He didn’t say
anything, just limped to the shelf, took down a book, and limped back out. Irv
called out, ‘Ciao, Quasimodo,’ and went back to his reading. He thought it was
a phase among phases. I followed Jacob to his room, sat beside him on his bed,
and asked, ‘Did you break your back?’ He nodded yes. ‘That must be incredibly
painful.’ He nodded. I suggested we reset his spine by taping a broom to his
back. He walked around like that for two days. He recovered.</p>

<p>“I was reading to him in bed a
couple of weeks later—his head propped on the pillow that had been the hump on
his back—and he pulled up the sleeve of his pajama top and said, ‘Look what
happened.’ I didn’t know what I was supposed to be seeing, only that I was
supposed to be seeing it, so I said, ‘That’s looks horrible.’ He nodded. ‘I got
a very bad burn,’ he said. ‘So I see,’ I said, very gently touching it. ‘Hold
on, I have some ointment in the medicine cabinet.’ I came back with
moisturizer. ‘For use on extreme burns,’ I said, pretending to read the
directions on the back. ‘Apply liberally across burn. Rub into skin as if
massaging. Full recovery expected by morning.’ I rubbed his arm for half an
hour, a massage that went through seasons of being pleasurable, and meditative,
and intimate, and, apparently, sedating. When he came into our bed the next
morning, he showed me his arm and said, ‘It worked.’ I said, ‘A miracle.’ ‘No,’
he said, ‘just medicine.’”</p>

<p>More laughter.</p>

<p>“Just medicine. I still think about
that all the time. No miracle, just medicine.</p>

<p>“The disabilities and injuries
continued to come—a cracked rib, loss of feeling in his left leg, broken
fingers—but with less and less frequency. Then, one morning, maybe a year after
he’d gone blind, Jacob didn’t come down for breakfast. He often overslept,
especially after nights when he and his father stayed up to watch the Orioles.
I tapped on his door. No answer. I opened it, and he was perfectly still on his
bed, arms and legs straight, with a note balanced in the well of his sternum:
‘I am feeling extremely sick, and think I might die tonight. If you are now
looking at me, and I’m not moving, it is because I am dead.’ If it were a game,
he’d have won it. But it wasn’t a game. I could rub cream into a burn, I could
set a broken back, but there is nothing to be done for the dead. I had loved
the intimacy of our secret understanding, but I no longer understood. I looked
at him lying there, my stoic child, so still. I started crying. Just as I’m
about to do now. I got on my knees beside Jacob’s body, and I cried and cried
and cried.”</p>

<p>Irv went to the dance floor and put
his arm around Deborah. He whispered something into her ear. She nodded, and
whispered something back. He whispered something back.</p>

<p>She collected herself and said, “I
cried a lot. I put my head on his chest and made little rivers in the channels
between his ribs. You were so skinny, Jacob. No matter how much you ate, you
were just bones. Just bones,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“You let me go on for a long time,
then coughed, and jerked your legs, and coughed again, and slowly came back to
life. I was never more angry than when you put yourself in danger. When you
didn’t look both ways, when you ran with scissors—I wanted to hit you. I
actually had to stop myself from hitting you. How could you be so careless with
the thing I most loved?</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t angry then. Only
devastated. ‘Don’t ever do that again,’ I told you. ‘Don’t you ever, ever do
that again.’ Still flat on your back, you turned your head to face me—do you
remember this?—and you said, ‘But I have to.’”</p>

<p>Deborah started crying again, and
handed Irv the page from which she’d been reading.</p>

<p>“In sickness and in health,” he
said. “Jacob and Julia, my son and daughter, there is only ever sickness. Some
people go blind, some go deaf. Some people break their backs, some get badly
burned. But you were right, Jacob: you would have to do it again. Not as a
game, or rehearsal, or tortuous effort to communicate something, but for real
and forever.”</p>

<p>Irv looked up from the page, turned
to Deborah, and said, “Jesus, Deborah, this is depressing.”</p>

<p>More laughter, but now from
trembling throats. Deborah laughed, too, and took Irv’s hand.</p>

<p>He kept reading: “In sickness and
in sickness. That is what I wish for you. Don’t seek or expect miracles. There
are no miracles. Not anymore. And there are no cures for the hurt that hurts
most. There is only the medicine of believing each other’s pain, and being
present for it.”</p>

<p>After having made love for the
first time as husband and wife, Jacob and Julia lay side by side. Side by side,
they looked at the ceiling.</p>

<p>Jacob said, “My mom’s speech was
great.”</p>

<p>“It was,” Julia said.</p>

<p>Jacob took her hand and said, “But
only the deafness part was true. None of the rest.”</p>

<p>Sixteen years later, alone with the
mother of his three children, on the stoop of their home and under only the
infinite ceiling, Jacob knew that everything his mother had said was true. Even
if he couldn’t remember it, even if it hadn’t happened. He chose illness,
because he knew of no other way to be seen. Not even by those looking for him.</p>

<p>But then Julia pressed his hand.
Not hard. Just enough pressure to communicate love. He felt love. Spousal,
co-parental, romantic, friendly, forgiving, devoted, resigned, stubbornly
hopeful—the kind didn’t matter. He had spent so much of his life standing at
thresholds, parsing love, withholding comfort, forcing happiness. She applied
more pressure to her still-husband’s hand, and held his eyes in the fingers of
her eyes, and told him, “Your grandfather died.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said, words that
originated in his spine.</p>

<p>“Sorry?”</p>

<p>“Wait, what? I didn’t hear you.”</p>

<p>“Your grandfather. Isaac. He’s
dead.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<h1>IV. FIFTEEN DAYS OF FIVE THOUSAND YEARS</h1>

<p>DAY 2</p>

<p>Asked to estimate how many are
trapped in the rubble, the chief of Israel’s recovery effort says, “One is ten
thousand too many.” The journalist follows up: “Are you suggesting ten
thousand?”</p>

<p>DAY 3</p>

<p>Statement from the Israeli interior
minister’s office: “This is not a time for petty squabbling. If the Islamists
want control, they can have control. If they want their holy sites preserved,
they can have that. But they cannot have both.”</p>

<p>To which the waqf responds: “The
Zionists have a history of underestimating Arabs, and of keeping what it
borrows.”</p>

<p>To which the interior minister
himself responds: “Israel never estimates, and Israel never borrows.”</p>

<p>DAY 4</p>

<p>New York Times public editor: “Many
readers have responded to the use of the word ‘disproportionate’ in yesterday’s
front-page projection of casualties in the Middle East.”</p>

<p>In Lebanon, the leader of Hezbollah
gives a TV address that contains the sentence “The earthquake was not a work of
nature, and it was not an earthquake.”</p>

<p>CBS Evening News anchor: “And
finally, tonight, a glimmer of hope amid the rubble. Here is the story of young
Adia, the three-year-old Palestinian girl who lost her parents and three
sisters in Nablus. Wandering amid the ruins, without even a last name, she took
the hand of the American photojournalist John Tirr, and refused to release it.”</p>

<p>DAY 5</p>

<p>The Israeli ambassador’s response:
“Perhaps we should ask the thirty-six Japanese citizens we ‘unilaterally,
clumsily, and brutally’ rescued, at the expense of our own blood, if they would
prefer to be airlifted back onto the Temple Mount.”</p>

<p>Military analyst on Fox News, on
the subject of Turkey’s uncoordinated use of Israeli airspace for supply
transport: “Israel’s nonreaction is either an unprecedented gesture of
cooperation or a sign of the unprecedented weakness of the Israeli Air Force.”</p>

<p>A twenty-two-year-old Arab Israeli
citizen with four missing siblings explains: “The glass bottle is useless as a
weapon, so it is deadly as a symbol.” The rioting, no longer spontaneous, is
known as the “tdamar,” the resentment.</p>

<p>The Syrian president: “Taking
effect immediately, the truce and strategic alliance will include the eleven
largest rebel groups.”</p>

<p>DAY 6</p>

<p>In Rome, the Pope announces: “The
Vatican will fund and oversee the restoration of the Holy Sepulcher.”</p>

<p>Response from the synod of the
Greek Orthodox Church: “The Vatican will do no such thing.”</p>

<p>Response from the catholicos of the
Armenian Church: “The ruins shall not be altered.”</p>

<p>The British Parliament passes a
resolution “to condition the shipment of British aid to be delivered directly
to the intended recipients, rather than through Israeli channels.”</p>

<p>Junior (and Jewish) senator from
California: “No doubt Israel is doing everything in her power to oversee the
broadest, most effective recovery effort. Clearly, Israel cannot hold
territories and renounce responsibility for the population.”</p>

<p>The German chancellor: “As Israel’s
closest friend in Europe, we counsel her to use this tragedy as an opportunity
to reach out to her Arab neighbors.”</p>

<p>Secret communiqué from the king of
Jordan to the prime minister of Israel: “Our need for aid has become so extreme
and urgent, we are no longer in a position to question its source.”</p>

<p>Response: “Is that a request, or a
threat?”</p>

<p>Response: “It is a statement.”</p>

<p>The American Israel Public Affairs
Committee announces the creation of two lists of public officials: “Defenders
of Israel” and “Betrayers of Israel.” The first posting identifies 512
Defenders and 123 Betrayers.</p>

<p>Poster in Amman: STOP CHOLERA.</p>

<p>DAY 7</p>

<p>The Egyptian foreign minister’s
response: “With regard to the March of a Million, we cannot prevent free people
from demonstrating their brotherhood with the suffering victims of the
earthquake.”</p>

<p>The Turkish ambassador to the UN
claims: “Israel has halved the number of aid ships allowed to enter Israeli
waters.”</p>

<p>Al Jazeera claims: “Medical
supplies intended for the West Bank are being held at Israeli-controlled border
crossings.”</p>

<p>The American secretary of state
claims: “Israel is fully cooperating with all good-faith partners.”</p>

<p>Syria claims: “We have moved ground
forces to our southern border for the purpose of self-defense.”</p>

<p>World Health Organization
statement: “Epidemic cholera, which has now been confirmed in more than a dozen
cities in the Palestinian Territories and Jordan, poses an even greater risk
than either aftershocks or war.”</p>

<p>In a phone call to the Israeli
prime minister, the American president reaffirms his country’s commitment to
help secure Israel “with whatever is required, without limitations,” but adds:
“This horrible disaster must inspire a fundamental change in the Middle East
axioms.”</p>

<p>CNN anchor, forefinger to earpiece:
“I’m sorry to interrupt. We’re getting reports that just before seven p.m.,
local time, another dramatic earthquake struck the Middle East, magnitude 7.3.”</p>

<p>DAY 8</p>

<p>From the head of Israeli civil
engineering’s report, delivered by secure videoconference to the homes of
Knesset members: “Among the critical structures damaged beyond use: the Defense
Ministry headquarters; the Geophysical Institute in Lod; Ben Gurion
International Airport; Tel Nof and Hatzor Air Force Bases. All highways have at
least partial obstructions. North–south access was blocked for ninety minutes.
Railways are inoperative. Ports are minimally functioning. As for the Kotel,
the portions that collapsed have not compromised the integrity of the Temple
Mount, but further geological events will likely lead to catastrophic failure.”</p>

<p>In the wake of the aftershock,
Saudi Arabia and Jordan sign an agreement of “temporary unification.” Asked why
Saudi Arabia’s unprecedentedly large supply line of aid also includes ground
troops, the Saudi king replies: “To assist in the recovery.” Asked why it
includes two hundred combat aircraft, he replies: “It doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Israel refuses to recognize
“Transarabia,” thereby naming it.</p>

<p>Iran promises, “Jordan will know no
greater ally than Iran,” thereby refusing to recognize Transarabia.</p>

<p>The UN Human Rights Council passes
a resolution condemning “the catastrophic crisis created by Israel’s
unilateral, unannounced, and complete withdrawal from the Occupied
Territories.” No member states abstain. No member states vote against the
resolution.</p>

<p>Asked by what means Egypt is
abrogating its treaties with Israel, the Egyptian Army chief responds: “All
agreements and understandings were created within a set of conditions that no
longer exist.” Asked if Egypt would continue to recognize the State of Israel:
“This is semantics.”</p>

<p>Chanting outside a Georgetown
University lecture hall, in which a visiting Israeli molecular biologist is
presenting a paper on differentiating pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells:
“Shame on Israel! Shame on Israel!”</p>

<p>375 Defenders and 260 Betrayers.</p>

<p>“And finally, tonight, an update on
a story that has captured the hearts of so many around the world—that of young
Adia. It’s with concern, but also hopes and prayers, that we report that the
improvised orphanage in which Adia had been staying partially collapsed in
yesterday’s aftershock. It’s believed that some of the building’s occupants
were able to escape, although, as with so many, Adia’s whereabouts are
unknown.”</p>

<p>DAY 9</p>

<p>Under the cover of repairmen, a
squad of Israeli extremists penetrates the Dome of the Rock and sets it on
fire. The arsonists are quickly detained. The prime minister of Israel issues a
statement calling the “attempted arson” a “terrorist plot.”</p>

<p>Financial Times: “Hamas’s
declaration of allegiance to the Islamic State marks another step toward the
unprecedented unification of the Muslim world.”</p>

<p>From the Israeli minister of
health’s report to the prime minister: “Hospitals are operating at
five-thousand percent capacity, and the influx of American supplies is neither
fast enough nor large enough. A cholera epidemic is inevitable, as are
dysentery and typhoid. As war approaches, it is necessary to make difficult
decisions regarding priorities.”</p>

<p>In a hastily arranged speech in
Azadi Square in Tehran, before a crowd estimated at two hundred thousand, the
Ayatollah intones: “O Jews, your time has come! You have burned down our Dome
of the Rock, and now your fire will be met by fire! We will burn your cities
and your towns, your schools and your hospitals, your every home! No Jew will
be safe!”</p>

<p>DAY 10</p>

<p>In his daily address to the nation,
the Israeli prime minister says, “Our reasons for this morning’s action are
simple: by expelling the waqf from the Temple Mount and deploying the IDF to
control it, we can show the world that the damage to the Dome of the Rock is
minimal and protect the site for as long as it is in danger.”</p>

<p>Europe’s three largest supermarket
chains remove kosher food from their shelves amid fears over protesters. In
response, a Tory MP tweets: “JEWS are not ISRAELIS! How DARE YOU!
#JewsAreKosher.”</p>

<p>American political commentator,
responding to the joint declaration of war by Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and
Transarabia: “It was a necessary response to the IDF taking the Temple Mount,
but there have been rocket attacks and air skirmishes for a week. This only
makes it official.”</p>

<p>The ultra-Orthodox population in
Jerusalem spreads a rumor that “the Messiah is at the door.”</p>

<p>The American president, addressing
a joint session of Congress: “Israel must immediately relinquish control of the
Temple Mount to an international peacekeeping force, refrain from any military
reprisals, and resume its participation in rescue efforts in the Occupied
Territories. If Israel fulfills its responsibilities, she will have America’s
unconditional and unlimited support.”</p>

<p>AIPAC adds the president to its
list of Betrayers.</p>

<p>DAY 11</p>

<p>Guardian editorial: “The issue
isn’t so much who raised the Israeli flag on the Temple Mount, but why hasn’t
it been taken down? Israel’s inaction seems designed to inflame.”</p>

<p>The caliph of the Islamic State
declares temporary unity with the “infidel Syrian government and Hezbollah.”</p>

<p>Turkish Air Force spokesman: “The
computer virus that attacked our air control system, leading to this morning’s
multiple crashes, was an act of war.”</p>

<p>The Israeli prime minister assures
the American president that Israel neither created nor implemented the alleged
virus.</p>

<p>The American president offers the
Turkish prime minister unprecedented aid and advanced weaponry in exchange for
a vow to stay out of the war.</p>

<p>Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros,
Djibouti, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan,
Qatar, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen declare war
on Israel.</p>

<p>The United States ends “executive
hold” on the pending sale of 60 Harpoon missiles, 185 M1A1 Abrams main battle
tank “upgrade kits,” 20 F-16 fighter jets, and 500 American-made Hellfire II
missiles to Egypt. The State Department declines to comment.</p>

<p>President of Columbia University’s
Hillel chapter, commenting on the first anti-Israel demonstrations led by
Jewish students: “The pursuit of justice, especially when it requires
introspection and humility, is at the heart of our mission: to enrich the lives
of Jewish students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world.”</p>

<p>CNN: “We have confirmed reports
that an American cargo plane, on its way to an airfield in the Negev, has
crashed.”</p>

<p>289 Defenders and 246 Betrayers.</p>

<p>DAY 12</p>

<p>Cover of the New York Post: the
still-raised Israeli flag beneath the headline DOME OF THE MOCK!</p>

<p>Albania, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh,
the Gambia, Guinea, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, the Maldives, Mali, Niger, Senegal,
Sierra Leone, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan declare war on Israel.</p>

<p>The Ayatollah publishes an open
letter to “Iran’s Arab brothers” that concludes: “Your reluctance to allow us
into the theater of battle will be your own demise. Whatever our differences,
this is our moment.”</p>

<p>The American secretary of state
offers the Israeli prime minister “as much aid as is needed” in exchange for
control over the war and Israel’s nuclear arsenal. After summarily rejecting
the proposal, the prime minister asks, “Why isn’t the president on the phone
with me right now?”</p>

<p>Young mother in Tel Aviv: “The
rockets are relentless, but the city’s sewage has flooded the shelters, so we
just wait outside for whatever will happen.”</p>

<p>In Brussels, the president of the
European Union delivers a speech in which he says, “The catastrophe in the
Middle East reveals a failed experiment.”</p>

<p>Israel declares war “against all of
those seeking to destroy the Jewish state.”</p>

<p>DAY 13</p>

<p>NPR: “The ‘March of a Million’ has
never been a fitting name. When it was a coherent march, it numbered fewer than
fifty thousand. Now it is numerous, uncoordinated campaigns—many origins, with
the shared destination of Jerusalem—which some have numbered at two million.”</p>

<p>A PEW poll finds that fifty-eight
percent of American Jews believe the United States should enter the war.</p>

<p>Associated Press reports: “Several
Bedouin tribes in the Negev claim that Israeli authorities are handing out
potassium iodide to the Jewish population near the nuclear site in Dimona, but
not to them.”</p>

<p>Israel offers no response to this,
or to Turkey’s belligerent rhetoric, or to claims that Israel is targeting
civilian utilities in the largest cities of Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and
Transarabia, or to the Transarabian Army’s occupation of the tourist city of
Eilat, or to the IDF’s decision to categorically purge Arab Israelis from the
Israeli Army, while simultaneously conscripting all Jewish men and women above
the age of sixteen for “paramilitary support.”</p>

<p>In major newspapers across America,
full-page ads, signed by one hundred evangelical leaders, assert: “We are all
Zionists.”</p>

<p>United Nations statement: “With the
number of earthquake refugees estimated to exceed twenty million; epidemic
cholera, dysentery, and typhoid causing more fatalities than either the
earthquake or the war; and an extreme shortage of food, potable water, and
medical supplies, the Middle East is facing a humanitarian crisis of
unprecedented proportions. We will either respond to this crisis immediately
and with overwhelming resolve, or face decades of global instability, and the
greatest loss of civilian life since the Second World War.”</p>

<p>DAY 14</p>

<p>Transarabian spokesperson:
“Bethlehem and Hebron have not been conquered, they have been reclaimed. This
historic victory would not have been possible without our brave brothers from
Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and Pakistan.”</p>

<p>The American president to the
Israeli prime minister: “It was Mossad. Our plane and Turkey’s.”</p>

<p>“What interest would Israel have in
downing a plane of our last noncombatant in the region, much less our closest
and most necessary ally?”</p>

<p>“That’s a question for you to ask
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I give you my word: Israel was in
no way involved with the downing of the American plane.”</p>

<p>Turkey declares war, “in
partnership with our Muslim brothers, against the Zionist Entity.”</p>

<p>301 Defenders and 334 Betrayers.</p>

<p>Military assessment given to
Israel’s prime minister: “The IDF is nearing collapse in the north and east.
The 5th, 7th, and 9th Divisions of the Syrian Army have full control of the
Golan Hights, and are preparing an offensive to capture the Galilee. The Transarabian
Army has penetrated the Negev.”</p>

<p>Spokesperson for the Israeli
settlers, resisting evacuation: “We will die in our homes.”</p>

<p>DAY 15</p>

<p>Ministry of Defense memorandum to
the prime minister of Israel:</p>

<p>To follow is our response to your
request for three viable strategies to win the war.</p>

<p>Strategy 1: Attrition</p>

<p>Israel has superior medical
resources, the disease epidemics are killing at a faster rate than warfare, and
a defensive position is less costly to maintain than an offensive one. We will
pull back to our defensible borders, enhance our already robust military
deployment, and allow the war to be won biologically. We will hasten the
process by disrupting lines of medical supply, and more crucially, of water.
There are options for taking more proactive steps in this regard, to be
discussed in person.</p>

<p>Strategy 2: Overwhelming Act</p>

<p>A nuclear strike would be the most
overwhelming display of force, but comes with too many risks, in terms of
unmanageable consequences, including reprisals and the American response.
Instead, we recommend two dramatic conventional attacks—one in the east, one in
the west. The most effective target in the west is the Aswan Dam. Ninety-five
percent of Egypt’s population lives within twelve miles of the Nile, and the
dam provides more than half of Egypt’s power. With the destruction of the dam,
Lake Nasser would run downstream, flooding virtually all of Egypt—massive
civilian casualties, certainly in the millions. Egypt would cease to be a
functioning society. In the east, we will bomb Transarabia’s main oil wells,
crippling the Arabs’ ability to prosecute the war.</p>

<p>Strategy 3: Reverse Diaspora</p>

<p>While the war has exposed a
widening gap between American and Israeli leadership, and between American and
Israeli Jews, Israel will, with the proper public relations campaign,
culminating with a speech delivered by the prime minister, persuade one hundred
thousand American Jews to come to Israel to support the war effort.</p>

<p>It will be an enormously costly
logistical effort, one that diverts men, equipment, and strategic focus from
the planning and execution of military operations. The vast majority of the
volunteers will have had no military training or experience, will not be in
fighting condition, and will not speak Hebrew. But their presence will force
America’s hand militarily. The president of the United States could watch eight
million Israeli Jews be slaughtered, but not one hundred thousand American
Jews.</p>

<p>Pending your response, we will
prepare a full and detailed course of action.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>V. NOT TO HAVE A CHOICE IS ALSO A CHOICE</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE I-WORD</h2>

<p>“Good afternoon. I want to extend
to the people of the region affected by yesterday’s earthquake the deep
condolences and unwavering support of the American people. The full extent of
the devastation is still unknown, but the images that we’ve seen of entire
neighborhoods in ruins, of fathers and mothers searching the rubble for their
children, are heartbreaking. Indeed, for a region that is no stranger to
suffering, this tragedy seems especially cruel and incomprehensible. Our
thoughts and prayers are with the people of the Middle East, and also with all
of those around our country who do not yet know the fates of loved ones back
home.</p>

<p>“I have directed my administration
to respond with the full resources of the United States in the urgent task of
rescuing those still trapped beneath the rubble, and to deliver the
humanitarian relief that will be needed in the coming days and weeks. In that
effort, our government, especially USAID and the Departments of State and Defense,
is working closely with our partners in the region and around the world.</p>

<p>“There are several urgent
priorities. First, we’re working quickly to account for U.S. embassy personnel
and their families in Tel Aviv, Amman, and Beirut, as well as the many American
citizens who live and work in the region. Americans trying to locate family
members are encouraged to contact the State Department at 299-306-2828.”</p>

<p>“Say it,” Tamir told the screen.</p>

<p>“Second,” the president continued,
ignoring Tamir, “we’ve mobilized resources to help rescue efforts. In disasters
such as this, the first days are absolutely critical to saving lives and
avoiding even greater tragedy, so I have directed my teams to be as
forward-leaning as possible in getting help on the ground and coordinating with
our international partners as well.”</p>

<p>“Say the word!”</p>

<p>“Third, given the many different
resources that are needed, we are taking steps to ensure that assisting
governments act in a unified way. I’ve designated the administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development, Dr. Philip Shaw, to be our unified
disaster coordinator.</p>

<p>“Now, this rescue and recovery
effort will be complex and challenging. As we move resources into the Middle
East, we will be working closely with partners on the ground, including local
government agencies, as well as the many NGOs, the United Nations missions—which
appear to have suffered their own losses—and our partners in the region and
around the world. This must truly be an international effort.”</p>

<p>“Say the word!”</p>

<p>For the first time in decades,
perhaps ever, Jacob remembered the Texas Instruments Speak &amp; Spell he’d had
as a child. He brought it to the beach one summer; it melted onto a picnic
table and wouldn’t stop repeating “Say it,” not even when it was turned
off—like a ghost: “Say it, say it, say it…”</p>

<p>“And, finally, let me just say that
this is a time when we are reminded of the common humanity that we all share.
Despite the fact that many are experiencing tough times here at home, I would
encourage those Americans who want to support the urgent humanitarian efforts
to go to WhiteHouse.gov, where you can learn how to contribute. This is not a
time to withdraw behind borders, but to extend ourselves—our compassion and our
resources—to the people of the Middle East. We must be prepared for difficult
hours and days ahead as we learn about the scope of the tragedy. We will keep
the victims and their families in our prayers. We will be aggressive and
resolute in our response. And I pledge to the region that you will have a
friend and partner in the United States of America, today and going forward.
May God bless you, and those working on your behalf. Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>“He just couldn’t bring himself to
say it.”</p>

<p>“Neither can you, apparently.”</p>

<p>Tamir gave Jacob that most annoying
of all looks: the put-on assumption that Jacob must be joking—surely he was joking.</p>

<p>“What? Military? Aid?”</p>

<p>Tamir muted the television, which
had moved on to images of fighter jets coring massive apples of smoke, and
said: “Israel.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you.”</p>

<p>“Of course he said it.”</p>

<p>“Of course he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“He did. He said, the people of
Israel.”</p>

<p>“Of the region.”</p>

<p>“Well, he definitely said Tel
Aviv.”</p>

<p>“But he definitely didn’t say
Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“He did. But if he didn’t—and I’m
sure he did—it’s only for all of the perfectly reasonable reasons you know.”</p>

<p>“Remind me of what I know.”</p>

<p>Tamir’s phone started ringing, and
as with every call he’d received since the earthquake, it didn’t have to ring
twice. It might be news from Rivka or Noam. It might be a response to one of
his dozen attempts to get home. E-mail had come back early that morning, so he
knew they were safe. But there were innumerable unaccounted-for family and
friends.</p>

<p>It was Barak calling from upstairs,
asking if he could use the iPad.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with yours?”</p>

<p>“We want two.”</p>

<p>Tamir hung up.</p>

<p>“It’s a regional catastrophe,”
Jacob resumed, “not an Israeli one. It’s geological, not political.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is not political,” Tamir
said.</p>

<p>“This isn’t political.”</p>

<p>“Give it a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“And if you were somewhat less
insistent on hearing your name, it would be somewhat easier to say.”</p>

<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“It’s our fault.”</p>

<p>“That came out wrong.”</p>

<p>“And can I ask you,” Tamir went on,
“who you is? When you say, ‘If you were somewhat less insistent,’ who is the
you?”</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“Me, Tamir?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Israelis.”</p>

<p>“Israelis. OK. I just wanted to be
sure you didn’t mean Jews.”</p>

<p>“Look, it was a statement, and he
was being careful.”</p>

<p>“But this isn’t political.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t want to make it
political.”</p>

<p>“So what’s the plan?” Julia asked,
walking into the room.</p>

<p>“Dumbarton Oaks,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Julia,” Tamir said, turning to
face her, “let me ask you. Do you feel a need to be careful when one of your
friends is injured?”</p>

<p>“Theoretically?”</p>

<p>“No, in life.”</p>

<p>“What kind of injury?”</p>

<p>“Something serious.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I’ve ever had a
seriously injured friend.”</p>

<p>“Some life.”</p>

<p>“Theoretically? Yes, I’d be
careful. If it were necessary.”</p>

<p>“And you?” Tamir asked Jacob.</p>

<p>“Of course I would be careful.”</p>

<p>“We’re different in that way.”</p>

<p>“You’re reckless?”</p>

<p>“I’m loyal.”</p>

<p>“Loyalty doesn’t require
recklessness,” Julia said, as if she were taking Jacob’s side, which she didn’t
feel like doing, especially without knowing what they were talking about.</p>

<p>“Yes, it does.”</p>

<p>“And no one is helped by a loyalty
that makes the situation worse,” Jacob said, wanting Julia to feel that he had
her back.</p>

<p>“Unless the situation is going to
get worse anyway. Your father would agree with me.”</p>

<p>“Which only proves the sanity of my
argument.”</p>

<p>Tamir laughed at that. And with his
laugh, the rising temperature was halved, the pressure relieved.</p>

<p>“What’s the best sushi in Washington?”
Tamir asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Jacob said, “but I
know it isn’t as good as the worst sushi in Israel, which is better than the
best sushi in Japan.”</p>

<p>“I’ll probably stick around here
while you guys go out today,” Julia said. “I’ve got some things to catch up
on.”</p>

<p>“What kind of things?” Tamir asked,
as only an Israeli would.</p>

<p>“Bar mitzvah stuff.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was canceled.”</p>

<p>Julia looked at Jacob. “You told
him it was canceled?”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“Don’t lie to your wife,” Tamir
said.</p>

<p>“Why do you keep saying that?”</p>

<p>“He keeps saying it?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>“You can’t see it,” Jacob told
Julia, “but he’s nudging me right now. So you know.”</p>

<p>Tamir gave Jacob another invisible
nudge and said, “You told me that with Isaac’s death, the earthquake, and what
happened between the two of you—”</p>

<p>“I did not say anything,” Jacob
said.</p>

<p>“Don’t lie to your wife, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“What, about Mark?” Julia asked.
“And did you tell him about your phone?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t told him about anything
that you just told him about.”</p>

<p>“And it’s none of my business,”
Tamir said.</p>

<p>Addressing only Julia, Jacob said,
“What I told him was that we were talking about how to modify the bar mitzvah,
in light of, you know, everything.”</p>

<p>“Modify what?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>How do children do that? Jacob
wondered. Not only enter rooms silently, but at the worst possible moment.</p>

<p>“Your bar mitzvah,” Max said. And
where did he come from?</p>

<p>“Mom and I were talking about how
to make sure the bar mitzvah feels good within the context of, you know.”</p>

<p>“The earthquake?”</p>

<p>“What earthquake?” Benjy asked,
without looking up from the maze he was drawing. Had he always been there?</p>

<p>“And Great-Grandpa,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Dad and I—”</p>

<p>“You can just say we,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“We don’t think we can have a
band,” Jacob said, taking over the parental side of the conversation in an
effort to demonstrate to Julia that he was also capable of delivering difficult
news.</p>

<p>“Fine,” Sam said. “They sucked shit
anyway.”</p>

<p>It’s very hard to have a productive
dialogue with a thirteen-year-old boy, as every gently broached subject becomes
an Ultimate Conversation, requiring defense systems and counterattacks to
attacks that were never launched. What begins as an innocent observation about
his habit of leaving things in the pockets of dirty clothes ends with Sam
blaming his parents for his twenty-eighth-percentile height, which makes him
want to commit suicide on YouTube.</p>

<p>“They didn’t suck,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>Still focusing on his maze, Benjy
said, “When Mom parked the car, it wasn’t right, so I picked it up and put it
in the right place.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for that,” Julia said to
Benjy. And then, to Sam: “There’s a nicer way to put it.”</p>

<p>“Jesus,” Sam said, “I’m not allowed
to have an opinion anymore?”</p>

<p>“Now, hold on a minute,” Jacob
said. “You chose them. Mom didn’t. I didn’t. You did. You watched the videos of
half a dozen bands, and it was your opinion that Electric Brigade should be the
band for your bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“They were the least pathetic of
three totally pathetic options, and I chose them under duress. That’s not the
same as being a groupie.”</p>

<p>“What duress?”</p>

<p>“The duress of being forced to have
a bar mitzvah when you know I find all of this shit to be bullshit.”</p>

<p>Jacob tried to spare Julia from
having to be the one, yet again, to object to bad language: “Shit to be
bullshit, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Is that poor usage?”</p>

<p>“Impoverished. And try to believe
me when I tell you I would have been every bit as happy not to pay the utterly
mediocre Electric Brigade five thousand dollars to play bad covers of bad
songs.”</p>

<p>“But the rite of passage is
nonnegotiable,” Sam confirmed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jacob said, “that’s
correct.”</p>

<p>“Because it was nonnegotiable for
you, because it was nonnegotiable for—”</p>

<p>“Correct again. That’s what Jewish
people do.”</p>

<p>“Not negotiate?”</p>

<p>“Have bar mitzvahs.”</p>

<p>“Ah … I’d completely misunderstood
the whole thing. And now that I realize we have bar mitzvahs because we have
bar mitzvahs, what I really feel moved to do is marry a Jewish woman and have
Jewish children.”</p>

<p>“You need to slow down,” Julia
said.</p>

<p>“And I definitely don’t want to be
buried,” Sam said, the Ultimate now within sight. “Especially if Jewish law
requires it.”</p>

<p>“So be cremated like me,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Or don’t die,” Benjy suggested.</p>

<p>Like a conductor zipping up a piece
of music, Julia gave a quick and stern “Enough,” and that was it. What was so
scary about her? What about that five-foot-four woman, who never inflicted
physical or emotional violence, or even saw a punishment all the way through,
terrified her husband and children to the point of unconditional surrender?</p>

<p>Jacob broke down the breakdown:
“The thing we want to be sensitive to is the appearance of enjoying life too
much in the face of Great-Grandpa’s death. Not to mention the earthquake. It
would be in poor taste, and also just feel bad.”</p>

<p>“The appearance of enjoying life?”
Sam asked.</p>

<p>“I’m just saying that some
sensitivity is required.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you the right way to
think about it,” Tamir began.</p>

<p>“Maybe later,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“So no band,” Sam said. “Is that
enough to make sure we don’t appear to enjoy life?”</p>

<p>“In Israel we don’t even have bar
mitzvah parties,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“Mazel tov,” Jacob told him. And
then, to Sam: “I might also skip the sign-in board.”</p>

<p>“Which I always wanted to skip,”
Sam said.</p>

<p>“Which I spent three weeks making
for you,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“You made it over the course of
three weeks,” Jacob corrected.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t spend three weeks
making it.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think that’s an
important clarification?”</p>

<p>He all of a sudden didn’t, so he
changed course: “I think we should also consider editing the centerpieces.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Julia asked, beginning to
understand that he was taking things from her, not Sam.</p>

<p>“I’ve never understood the desire
of American Jews to speak words you don’t understand,” Tamir said. “Finding
meaning in the absence of meaning—I don’t get it.”</p>

<p>“They’re … festive,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“They’re elegant.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” Sam said, “what’s
left?”</p>

<p>“What’s left?”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“What’s left,” Jacob said, resting
his hand on Sam’s shoulder for the instant before Sam recoiled, “is you
becoming a man.”</p>

<p>“What’s left,” Julia said, “is
being with your family.”</p>

<p>“You are the luckiest people in the
history of the world,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“We’re trying,” Jacob said to Sam,
who lowered his eyes and said, “This sucks.”</p>

<p>“It won’t,” Julia said. “We’ll make
it really special.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say it will suck. I said
it sucks. Presently.”</p>

<p>“You’d rather be in a fridge like
Great-Grandpa?” Jacob asked, as surprised as anyone by his words. How could he
have thought them, much less vocalized them? Or these: “You’d rather be trapped
under a building in Israel?”</p>

<p>“Those are my choices?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>“No, but they are your much-needed
perspective. Look at that,” Jacob said, pointing to the muted TV, which showed
images of massive earthmoving machines, tires with ladders built into them,
pulling apart rubble.</p>

<p>Sam took this in, nodded, averted
his eyes to a place yet farther from where they would have met his parents’.</p>

<p>“No flowers,” he said.</p>

<p>“No flowers?”</p>

<p>“Too beautiful.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure beauty is the
problem,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“The problem,” Tamir said, “is
that—”</p>

<p>“It’s part of the problem,” Sam
said, talking over Tamir, “so lose ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about losing
them,” Jacob said, “as they’ve already been paid for. But we can ask if it’s
still possible to shift the design toward something more in keeping with—”</p>

<p>“And let’s ditch the monogrammed
yarmulkes, too.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Julia asked, hurt as only
someone who had spent six hours choosing a font, palette, and material for
monogrammed yarmulkes could be.</p>

<p>“They’re decorative,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“OK,” Jacob said, “maybe they’d be
a bit gauche, considering.”</p>

<p>“Gauche they are not,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“The problem—” Tamir began, again.</p>

<p>“And it probably goes without
saying,” Sam said, as he always did when he was about to say something that did
not go without saying, “that we’re not going to have party favors.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, I have to draw a line,”
Julia said.</p>

<p>“I actually think he’s right,”
Jacob said.</p>

<p>“You do?” Julia said. “Actually?”</p>

<p>“I do,” Jacob said, not liking that
mimicked actually, actually. “Party favors imply a party.”</p>

<p>“The problem—”</p>

<p>“Of course they don’t.”</p>

<p>“Party favor, Julia.”</p>

<p>“They imply a social convention,
the lack of whose fulfillment would imply extreme rudeness. Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Social convention at the
conclusion of a party.”</p>

<p>“So we punish his friends for plate
tectonics and the death of Sam’s great-grandfather?”</p>

<p>“Punishing thirteen-year-old
children is encumbering them with garbage bags full of tourist tchotchkes from
places Sam’s distant and uncared-about relatives live and calling it a favor.”</p>

<p>“You imply an asshole,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Whoa,” Barak said.</p>

<p>Where had he come from?</p>

<p>“Excuse me?” Jacob said, exactly as
Julia would have.</p>

<p>“I’m not chanting Torah,” Julia
said. “We know what these words mean.”</p>

<p>“What’s gotten into you?”</p>

<p>“It was always there.”</p>

<p>The television filled with tiny
flashes, like fireflies trapped in a jar.</p>

<p>“The problem,” Tamir said, standing
up, “is that you don’t have nearly enough problems.”</p>

<p>“Can I state the obvious?” Sam
asked.</p>

<p>“No,” his parents said
simultaneously—a rare unity.</p>

<p>There was a woman on TV, of unknown
ethnicity or nationality, pulling at her hair as she wailed, pulling with
enough force to yank her head left and right. There was no ticker across the
bottom of the screen. There was no commentary. There was no cause offered for
her suffering. There was only the suffering. Only the woman, her hair gathered
in the fists she beat against her chest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ABSORB OR ABSOLVE</h2>

<p>When Isaac should have been well
into his decomposition in the ground, he was still maintaining freshness in a
human crisper in Bethesda. Only for Isaac could the end of misery be the
extension of misery. His final wish—made known both in his will and in far too
many conversations with Irv, Jacob, and whoever else might be entrusted with
the task—was to be buried in Israel.</p>

<p>“But why?” Jacob had asked.</p>

<p>“Because that’s where Jews go.”</p>

<p>“On Christmas break. Not for
eternity.”</p>

<p>And when Sam, who was along for the
visit, pointed out that he would get far fewer visitors over there, Isaac
pointed out that “the dead are dead” and visits are the last things on their
brain-dead minds.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to be buried with
Grandma and the rest of the family?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll all meet when the moment is
right.”</p>

<p>“What the hell does that mean?”
Jacob didn’t ask, because there are times when meaning itself means very
little. A dying wish is such a time. Isaac had arranged the plot two decades
before—it was expensive even then, but he didn’t mind being grave-poor—so all
that was required in order to fulfill his last and most lasting wish was to get
his body on a plane and work out the logistics on the other side.</p>

<p>But when the time came to drop
Isaac’s body in the mailbox, the logistics were impossible: all flights were
grounded, and when the airspace reopened, the only bodies the country allowed
in were of those prepared to die.</p>

<p>Once the ritually mandated window
for a burial-in-one-day had passed, there was no great rush to figure out a
solution. But that’s not to say that the family was indifferent to Jewish
ritual. Someone had to be with the body at all times between death and burial.
The synagogue had a crew for this, but as the days passed, enthusiasm for
babysitting the cadaver waned, and more and more responsibility fell to the
Blochs. And that responsibility had to be negotiated with the responsibility of
hospitably hosting the Israelis: Irv could take them to Georgetown while Jacob
sat with Isaac’s body, and then in the afternoon Jacob could take them to the
Air and Space Museum to see To Fly! on the perspective-swallowing IMAX while
Deborah had the exact opposite experience with Isaac’s body. The patriarch with
whom they begrudgingly skyped for seven minutes once a week was now someone
they visited daily. By some uniquely Jewish magic, the transition from living
to dead transformed the perpetually ignored into the never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Jacob accepted the brunt of the
responsibility, because he considered himself the most able to do so, and
because he most strongly wanted to escape other responsibilities. He sat
shmira—an expression he’d never heard before he became a choreographer of
shmira sitters—at least once a day, usually for several hours at a time. For
the first three days, the body was kept on a table, under a sheet, at the
Jewish burial home. Then it was moved to a secondary space in the back, and
finally, at the end of the week, to Bethesda, where unburied bodies go to die.
Jacob never got any closer than ten feet, and dialed the podcasts to
hearing-impairing volumes, and tried not to inhale through his nose. He brought
books, went through e-mail (he had to stand on the other side of the door to
get cell reception), even got some writing done: HOW TO PLAY DISTRACTION; HOW
TO PLAY GHOSTS; HOW TO PLAY INCOMMUNICABLE, FELT MEMORIES.</p>

<p>Sunday, mid-morning, when Max’s
ritualized complaints of there being nothing to do became intolerably
exasperating, Jacob suggested Max come along for some shmira sitting, thinking,
This will make you grateful for your boredom. Calling his bluff, Max accepted.</p>

<p>They were greeted at the door by
the previous shmira sitter—an ancient woman from the shul who evoked so much
chilliness and vacancy she might have been mistaken for one of the dead if her
overapplication of makeup had not given her away: only living Jews are
embalmed. They exchanged nods, she handed Jacob the keys to the front door,
reminded him that absolutely nothing other than toilet paper (and number two,
of course) could be flushed down the toilet, and, with somewhat less pomp and
circumstance than happens outside Buckingham Palace, the changing of the guard
was complete.</p>

<p>“It smells horrible,” Max observed,
seating himself at the reception area’s long oak table.</p>

<p>“I breathe through my mouth when I
have to breathe.”</p>

<p>“It smells like someone farted into
a vodka bottle.”</p>

<p>“How do you know what vodka smells
like?”</p>

<p>“Grandpa made me smell it.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“To prove that it was expensive.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t the price do that?”</p>

<p>“Ask him.”</p>

<p>“Chewing gum helps, too.”</p>

<p>“Do you have any gum?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>They talked about Bryce Harper, and
why, despite the genre being too exhausted to raise an original finger,
superhero movies were still pretty great, and as often happened, Max asked his
dad to recount Argus stories.</p>

<p>“We took him to a dog training
class once. Did I ever tell you that?”</p>

<p>“You did. But tell me again.”</p>

<p>“So it was right after we got him.
The teacher began by demonstrating a belly rub that would relax a dog when it
became agitated. We were sitting in a circle, maybe twenty people, everyone
working away at his dog’s belly, and then the room filled with a loud rumbling,
like the Metro running beneath the building. It was coming from my lap. Argus
was snoring.”</p>

<p>“That’s so cute.”</p>

<p>“So cute.”</p>

<p>“He’s not very well behaved,
though.”</p>

<p>“We dropped out. Felt like a waste
of time. But a couple of years later, Argus got into the habit of pulling on
the leash when we walked. And he’d just stop abruptly and refuse to take
another step. So we hired some guy that people in the park were using. I can’t
remember his name. He was from Saint Lucia, kind of fat, had a limp. He put a
choke collar on Argus and observed as we walked with him. Sure enough, Argus
stopped short. ‘Give him a pull,’ the guy said. ‘Show him who’s the alpha dog.’
That made Mom laugh. I gave a pull, because, you know, I’m the alpha dog. But
Argus wouldn’t budge. ‘Harder,’ the guy said, so I pulled harder, but Argus
pulled back as hard. ‘You got to show him,’ the man said. I pulled again, this
time quite hard, and Argus made a little choking noise, but still wouldn’t
budge. I looked at Mom. The guy said, ‘You’ve got to teach him, otherwise it’ll
be like this forever.’ And I remember thinking: I can live with this forever.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t sleep that night. I
felt so guilty about having pulled him so hard that last time, making him
choke. And that expanded to guilt about all of the things I’d ever tried to
teach him: to heel, offer his paw on command, even to come back. If I could do
it all again, I wouldn’t try to teach him anything.”</p>

<p>An hour passed, and then another.</p>

<p>They played a game of Hangman, and
then another thousand. Max’s phrases were always inspired, but it was hard to
say by what: NIGHT BEFORE NIGHTTIME; ASTHMA THROUGH BINOCULARS; BLOWING A KISS
TO AN UNKINDNESS OF RAVENS.</p>

<p>“That’s what you call a group of
ravens,” he said after Jacob had solved it with only a head, torso, and left
arm.</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“A lamentation of swans. A
glittering of hummingbirds. A radiance of cardinals.”</p>

<p>“How do you know all that?”</p>

<p>“I like knowing things.”</p>

<p>“Me, too.”</p>

<p>“A minyan of Jews.”</p>

<p>“Excellent.”</p>

<p>“An argument of Blochs.”</p>

<p>“A universe of Max.”</p>

<p>They played a word game called
Ghost, in which they took turns adding letters to a growing fragment, trying
not to be the one to complete a word, while having a word in mind that the
fragment could spell.</p>

<p>“A.”</p>

<p>“A-B.”</p>

<p>“A-B-S.”</p>

<p>“A-B-S-O.”</p>

<p>“A-B-S-O-R.”</p>

<p>“Shit.”</p>

<p>“Absorb.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I was thinking absolve.”</p>

<p>They played Twenty Questions, Two
Truths and a Lie, and Fortunately Unfortunately. Each wished there were a TV to
lighten their load.</p>

<p>“Let’s go look at him,” Max said,
as casually as if he’d been suggesting they dig into the dried mango they’d
brought along.</p>

<p>“Great-Grandpa?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s there.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Why not isn’t an answer.”</p>

<p>“Neither is why.”</p>

<p>Why not? It wasn’t prohibited. It
wasn’t disrespectful. It wasn’t, or shouldn’t be, disgusting.</p>

<p>“I took a philosophy class in
college. I can’t remember what it was called, and can’t even remember the
professor, but I do remember learning that some prohibitions aren’t ethically
grounded, but rather because certain things are not to be done. One could reach
for all sorts of reasons that it isn’t right to eat the bodies of humans who
died of natural causes, but at the end of the day, it’s just not something we
do.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say eat him.”</p>

<p>“No, I know. I’m just making a
point.”</p>

<p>“Who would want to eat a human?”</p>

<p>“It would almost certainly smell
and taste good. But we don’t do it, because it’s not to be done.”</p>

<p>“Who decides?”</p>

<p>“Excellent question. Sometimes the
not to be done is universal, sometimes it’s particular to a culture, or even to
a family.”</p>

<p>“Like how we eat shrimp, but don’t
eat pork.”</p>

<p>“We don’t eat shrimp as a practice.
We on occasion eat some shrimp. But yes, like that.”</p>

<p>“Except this isn’t like that.”</p>

<p>“What isn’t?”</p>

<p>“Looking at Great-Grandpa.”</p>

<p>He was right; it wasn’t.</p>

<p>Max went on: “We’re here to be with
him, right? So why wouldn’t we be with him? What’s the point of coming all the
way here, and spending all this time, just to be in a different room? We might
as well have sat at home with popcorn and a streaming video of his body.”</p>

<p>Jacob was afraid. It was a very
simple explanation, even if the explanation for that explanation was harder to
come by. What was there to be afraid of? The proximity to death? Not exactly.
The proximity to imperfection? The embodied proof of reality, in its grotesque
honesty? The proximity to life.</p>

<p>Max said, “See you on the other
side,” and entered the room.</p>

<p>Jacob remembered the night, decades
before, when he and Tamir had snuck into the National Zoo.</p>

<p>“You OK?” he called to Max.</p>

<p>“Freaky,” Max said.</p>

<p>“I told you.”</p>

<p>“That’s not what you told me.”</p>

<p>“How does he look?”</p>

<p>“Come see for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’m comfortable where I am.”</p>

<p>“He looks like he does on Skype,
but farther away.”</p>

<p>“He looks OK?”</p>

<p>“I probably wouldn’t put it like
that.”</p>

<p>How did he look? Would the body
have looked different if he’d died differently?</p>

<p>Isaac had been the embodiment of
Jacob’s history; his people’s psychological pantry, the shelves collapsed; his
heritage of incomprehensible strength and incomprehensible weakness. But now he
was only a body. The embodiment of Jacob’s history was only a body.</p>

<p>They used to take baths together
when Jacob slept over as a child, and the long hairs of Isaac’s arms, chest,
and legs would float on the surface like pond vegetation.</p>

<p>Jacob remembered watching his
grandfather fall asleep under the barber’s cape, how his head slumped forward,
how the straight razor mowed a path from the back of his hairline to the limits
of the barber’s reach.</p>

<p>Jacob remembered being invited to
pull at the loose skin of his grandfather’s elbow until it stretched to a web
large enough to hold a baseball.</p>

<p>He remembered the smell after his
grandfather used the bathroom: it didn’t disgust him, it terrified him. He was
mortally afraid of it.</p>

<p>He remembered how his grandfather
wore his belt just below the nipples, and his socks just above the knees; and
how his fingernails were as thick as quarters, and his eyelids as thin as
tinfoil; and how between claps he turned his palms skyward, as if repeatedly
opening and shutting an invisible book, as if unable not to give the book a
chance, and unable not to reject it, and unable not to give it another chance.</p>

<p>Once, he fell asleep in the middle
of a game of Uno, his mouth half full of black bread. Jacob might have been
Benjy’s age. He carefully replaced his grandfather’s mediocre hand with all
Wild Draw Fours, but when he shook his grandfather awake and they resumed the
game, Isaac showed no wonder at his cards, and on his next turn drew from the
stack.</p>

<p>“You don’t have anything?” Jacob
asked.</p>

<p>Isaac shook his head and said,
“Nothing.”</p>

<p>He remembered watching his
grandfather change into a bathing suit wherever happened to be convenient, with
no regard for his own privacy or Jacob’s mortification: beside the parked car,
in the middle of a men’s room, even on the beach. Did he not know? Did he not
care? Once, at the public pool they sometimes went to on Sunday mornings, his
grandfather undressed poolside. Jacob could feel the glances of strangers
rubbing together inside him, building and tending to a fire of rage: at the
strangers for their judgment, at his grandfather for his lack of dignity, at
himself for his humiliation.</p>

<p>The lifeguard came over and said,
“There’s a changing room behind the vending machines.”</p>

<p>“OK,” his grandfather said, as if
he’d been told there was a Home Depot just off the Beltway.</p>

<p>“You can’t change here.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>Jacob spent decades thinking about
that Why not? Why not, because the changing room was over there, and here was
right here? Why not, because why are we even talking about this? Why not,
because if you’d seen the things I’ve seen, you would also lose your ability to
comprehend embarrassment? Why not, because a body is only a body?</p>

<p>A body is only a body. But before
he was a body, he was an embodiment. And that, at least for Jacob, was why not:
his grandfather’s body couldn’t be only a body.</p>

<p>For how long could this continue?</p>

<p>Irv argued that they should just
buy a plot in Judean Gardens, as close to the rest of the family as possible,
and get on with death already. Jacob insisted they wait until things cleared up
in Israel and then fulfill Isaac’s unambiguous wish for his eternal resting
place.</p>

<p>“And what if that takes a couple of
months?”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll owe the funeral home
that much more rent.”</p>

<p>“And if things never clear up?”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll remember how lucky we
were to have this as the biggest of our problems.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>WHAT DO THE CHILDREN KNOW?</h2>

<p>Julia wanted to rehearse the
conversation with the kids. Jacob could have argued that it was unnecessary
right then, as they weren’t going to have the actual conversation until after
the bar mitzvah and burial dust had cleared. But he agreed, hoping that Julia’s
ears would hear what her mouth said. And more, he interpreted her desire to
rehearse as a desire to role-play—an acknowledgment that she wasn’t sure. Just
as she interpreted his willingness to rehearse as a sign that he was, in fact,
ready to move forward with the end.</p>

<p>“‘We need to talk about
something’?” Julia suggested.</p>

<p>Jacob considered that for a moment,
and countered: “‘We need to have a family conversation’?”</p>

<p>“Why is that better?”</p>

<p>“It reaffirms that we’re a family.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t have family
conversations. It’ll tip them off that something’s wrong.”</p>

<p>“Something is wrong.”</p>

<p>“The entire point we’re trying to
convey with this conversation is that nothing is wrong. Something is
different.”</p>

<p>“Not even Benjy will buy that.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t even have money—”
Benjy said.</p>

<p>“Benjy?”</p>

<p>“—to buy something.”</p>

<p>“What’s going on, love?”</p>

<p>“What would you wish?”</p>

<p>“What’s that, baby?”</p>

<p>“In school, Mr. Schneiderman asked
us what we would wish, and he took our wishes to the Wailing Wall, because he
was going to Israel for vacation. I think I made the wrong wish.”</p>

<p>“What did you wish for?” Jacob
asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you or it won’t come
true.”</p>

<p>“What do you think you should have
wished for?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you, in case I change
my wish.”</p>

<p>“If sharing them means they can’t
come true, why are you asking us to tell you our wishes?”</p>

<p>“Oh yeah,” he said, then turned and
walked out of the living room.</p>

<p>They waited until they heard his
footsteps vanishing up the staircase before continuing.</p>

<p>“And anyway,” Julia said, in a
quieter voice than before, “we want to make them feel safe, and then build to
the change.”</p>

<p>“‘Can you guys come into the living
room for a minute?’ Like that?”</p>

<p>“Not the kitchen?”</p>

<p>“I think here.”</p>

<p>“And then what,” Julia said, “we
tell them to sit down?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s going to be a
tip-off, too.”</p>

<p>“We could just wait until we’re all
in the car at some point.”</p>

<p>“That could work.”</p>

<p>“But then we can’t face them.”</p>

<p>“Except in the rearview mirror.”</p>

<p>“An unfortunate symbol.”</p>

<p>That made Jacob laugh. She was
trying to be funny. There was a kindness in her effort. If this were real,
Julia would never make a joke.</p>

<p>“During dinner?” Julia suggested.</p>

<p>“That would first require
explaining why we’re eating dinner together.”</p>

<p>“We eat dinner together all the
time.”</p>

<p>“We briefly assemble at the table
occasionally.”</p>

<p>“What’s for dinner?” Max asked,
tumbling into the room exactly like Kramer, despite never having seen Seinfeld.</p>

<p>Julia gave Jacob a look he’d seen a
million times in a million contexts: What do the children know? What did Sam
know when, two years ago, he walked into the room while they were having
sex—missionary and under a sheet and without filthy talk, thank goodness. When
Max picked up the phone while Jacob was angrily interrogating Julia’s
gynecologist about the benignness of a benign lump—what did he hear? When Benjy
walked into their kitchen blow-up and said, “Epitome”—what did he know?</p>

<p>“We were just talking about
dinner,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>

<p>“You heard?”</p>

<p>“I thought you were calling us for
dinner.”</p>

<p>“It’s only four thirty.”</p>

<p>“I thought—”</p>

<p>“You’re hungry?”</p>

<p>“What’s for dinner?”</p>

<p>“What’s that have to do with your
hunger?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“Just wondering.”</p>

<p>“Lasagna and some veggie or
another,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Plain lasagna?”</p>

<p>“Spinach.”</p>

<p>“I’m not hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have an hour to work up
an appetite for spinach lasagna.”</p>

<p>“I think Argus needs a walk.”</p>

<p>“I just gave him a walk,” Jacob
said.</p>

<p>“Did he poo?”</p>

<p>“I can’t remember.”</p>

<p>“You would remember if he’d pooed,”
Max said. “He needs to poo. He’s doing that thing where he licks at the
beginning of a poo that needs to come out.”</p>

<p>“Why are you telling us this,
instead of just walking him?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m working on my speech
for Great-Grandpa’s funeral, and I need to concentrate.”</p>

<p>“You’re giving a speech?” Jacob
asked.</p>

<p>“You aren’t?”</p>

<p>Julia was touched by Max’s
charmingly narcissistic initiative. Jacob was ashamed by his own narcissistic
thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>“I’ll say a few words. Or actually,
Grandpa will probably speak on our behalf.”</p>

<p>“Grandpa doesn’t speak on my
behalf,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Work on your speech,” Julia said.
“Dad will walk Argus.”</p>

<p>“I did walk Argus.”</p>

<p>“Until he poos.”</p>

<p>Max went to the kitchen and came
out with a box of unhealthy organic cereal, which he took back to his room.</p>

<p>Julia called up: “Cereal should be
in your mouth or in the box. Nowhere else.”</p>

<p>Max called down: “I can’t swallow
it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a mistake to talk to
all of them at once,” Jacob said, careful with his volume. “Maybe we should
talk to Sam first.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I could see the—”</p>

<p>“Jesus.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Jacob gestured at the TV that was
now always on. There were images from a soccer stadium in Jerusalem, a stadium
in which Jacob and Tamir had seen a game more than two decades before. There
were a dozen bulldozers. It wasn’t clear what they were doing, or why Israel
would allow such images to be broadcast, and that not-knowing was terrifying.
Could they be preparing a military site? Digging a mass grave?</p>

<p>The news that reached America was
scattershot, unreliable, and alarmist. The Blochs did what they did best:
balanced overreaction with repression. If in their hearts they believed they
were safe, they overworried, talked and talked, whipped themselves, and one
another, into foams of anguish. From the comfort of the living room, they
followed the unfolding news like a sporting event, and at times caught
themselves rooting for drama. There were even small, shameful disappointments
when estimates of destruction were revised downward, or when what appeared to
be an act of aggression turned out to be only an accident. It was a game whose
unreal danger was to be talked up and savored, so long as the outcome was
fixed. But if there was an inkling of any real danger, if the shit started to
thicken—as it was soon to do—they dug until the blades of their shovels threw sparks:
It’ll be fine, it’s nothing.</p>

<p>Tamir was largely absent. He spent
part of every day trying to find a way home, but never with any success. If he
talked with Rivka or Noam, he did so privately and didn’t share anything. And
to Jacob’s amazement, he still wanted to sightsee, schlepping an unenthusiastic
Barak from monument to monument, museum to museum, Cheesecake Factory to Ruth’s
Chris Steakhouse. It was so easy for Jacob to see in Tamir what he couldn’t see
in himself: a refusal to acknowledge reality. He sightsaw so he wouldn’t have
to look.</p>

<p>The scene at the stadium was
replaced with the face of Adia, the young Palestinian girl whose entire family
had been killed in the earthquake and who was found wandering the streets by an
American photojournalist. The story touched the world, and kept touching it.
Maybe it was as simple as her beautiful face. Maybe it was how they held hands.
It was a feel-good piece amid the tragedy, but it was a tragedy, Jacob thought,
or at least inauspicious, that the good feeling was between a Palestinian and
an American. At some point, Max started sleeping with a newspaper photo of Adia
under his pillow. When her orphanage collapsed and she went missing, Max went
missing, too. Everyone knew where he was—it was only his voice, gaze, and teeth
that were hidden—but no one knew how to find him.</p>

<p>“Hello?” Julia asked, shaking her
hand in front of Jacob’s face.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You’ve been watching while we’ve
been talking?”</p>

<p>“Out of the corner of my eye.”</p>

<p>“I realize the Middle East is
collapsing, and that the entire world will get sucked into the vortex, but this
is actually more important right now.”</p>

<p>She got up and turned off the TV.
Jacob thought he heard it sigh in relief.</p>

<p>“Go walk Argus, then let’s finish
this.”</p>

<p>“He’ll go to the door and whine
when he really needs it.”</p>

<p>“Why make him really need it?”</p>

<p>“When it’s time, I mean.”</p>

<p>“You think we should talk to Sam
first? Before the others?”</p>

<p>“Or Sam and Max. Just in case one
of them starts crying. Benjy is going to follow their lead, so we should give
them a chance to digest and gather themselves.”</p>

<p>“Or just let them all cry
together,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Maybe just Sam first. He’s
probably going to have the strongest reaction—whatever that reaction will
be—but he’s also the most able to process it.”</p>

<p>Julia touched one of the art books
on the coffee table.</p>

<p>“What if I cry?” she asked.</p>

<p>The question embodied Jacob, made
him want to touch her—grasp her shoulder, press his palm to her cheek, feel the
ridges and valleys of their fingerprints align—but he didn’t know if that was
acceptable anymore. Her stillness throughout the conversation didn’t feel
standoffish, but it did create a space around her. What if she cried? Of course
she would cry. They would all cry. They’d wail. It would be horrible. The kids’
lives would be ruined. Tens of thousands of people would die. Israel would be
destroyed. He wanted all of that, not because he craved horror, but because
imagining the worst kept him safe from it—focusing on doomsday allowed for the
day to day.</p>

<p>On a drive to visit Isaac many
years before, Sam had asked from the backseat, “God is everywhere, right?”</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia exchanged yet
another where-the-hell-did-that-come-from look.</p>

<p>Jacob handled it: “That’s what
people who believe in God tend to think, yes.”</p>

<p>“And God has always been
everywhere?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“So here’s what I can’t figure
out,” he said, watching the early moon follow them as they drove. “If God was
everywhere, where did He put the world when He made it?”</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia exchanged another
look, this one of awe.</p>

<p>Julia turned to face Sam, who was
still looking out the window, his pupils constantly returning, like a
typewriter carriage, and said, “You are an amazing person.”</p>

<p>“OK,” Sam said, “but where did He
put it?”</p>

<p>That night, Jacob did a bit of
research and learned that Sam’s question had inspired volumes of thought over
thousands of years, and that the most prevalent response was the kabbalistic
notion of tzimtzum. Basically, God was everywhere, and as Sam surmised, when He
wanted to create the world, there was nowhere to put it. So He made Himself
smaller. Some refered to it as an act of contraction, others a concealment.
Creation demanded self-erasure, and to Jacob, it was the most extreme humility,
the purest generosity.</p>

<p>Sitting with her now, rehearsing
the horrible conversation, Jacob wondered if maybe, all those years, he had
misunderstood the spaces surrounding Julia: her quiet, her steps back. Maybe
they weren’t buffers of defense, but of the most extreme humility, the purest
generosity. What if she wasn’t withdrawing, but beckoning? Or both at the same
time? Withdrawing and beckoning? And more to the point: making a world for
their children, even for Jacob.</p>

<p>“You won’t cry,” he told her,
trying to enter the space.</p>

<p>“Would it be bad to?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose, all
things being equal, it would be best not to impose that on them. Impose isn’t
the right word. I mean … You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>He was surprised, and further
embodied, by her I do. “We’ll go over this a few dozen times and it’ll feel
different.”</p>

<p>“It will never not destroy me.”</p>

<p>“And the adrenaline in the moment
will help hold the tears back.”</p>

<p>“You’re probably right.”</p>

<p>You’re probably right. It had been
a long time—it had felt like a long time, Dr. Silvers would correct—since she’d
deferred to his emotional judgment in any way. Since she hadn’t reflexively
bucked against it. There was a kindness in those words—you’re probably
right—that disarmed him. He didn’t need to be right, but he needed that
kindness. What if, all those times she reflexively bucked against, or simply
dismissed, his perspective, she’d given him a you’re probably right? He would
have found it very easy to concede inside that kindness.</p>

<p>“And if you cry,” Jacob said, “you
cry.”</p>

<p>“I just want to make it easy on them.”</p>

<p>“No chance of that.”</p>

<p>“As easy as it can be.”</p>

<p>“Whatever happens, we’ll find our
way.”</p>

<p>We’ll find our way. What an odd
assurance, Julia thought, when the point of the conversation they were
rehearsing was precisely that they couldn’t find their way. Not together. And
yet the assurance took the form of togetherness: we.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll get a glass of water,”
she said. “Do you want one?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go to the door and whine when
I really need it.”</p>

<p>“You think the kids are losing?”
she asked as she walked to the kitchen. Jacob wondered if the water was just an
excuse to face away when asking that question.</p>

<p>“I’m just going to turn on the TV
for one second. On mute. I just need to see what’s happening.”</p>

<p>“What about what’s happening here?”</p>

<p>“I’m here. You asked if I think the
kids are losing. Yes, I think that’s the only way to describe it.”</p>

<p>A map of the Middle East, swooping
arrows indicating the movements of various armies. There had been skirmishes,
mostly with Syria and Hezbollah in the north. The Turks were taking an
increasingly hostile tone, and the newly formed Transarabia was amassing planes
and troops in what had been Jordan. But it was containable, controllable,
plausibly deniable.</p>

<p>Jacob said, “Rest assured, I’ll be
crying.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have some water.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear what you said.”</p>

<p>“I said, even if you don’t see me
crying, I’ll be crying.”</p>

<p>That was something—that felt like
something—he needed to say. He’d always known—always felt—that Julia believed
she had a stronger emotional engagement with the children, that being a mother,
or a woman, or simply herself, created a bond that a father, man, or Jacob was
incapable of. She’d subtly suggest it all the time—it felt like she was subtly
suggesting it—and would every now and then outright say it, although it was
always couched in talk of all the things that were special to his relationship
with them, like having fun.</p>

<p>Her perception of their parental
identities generally broke that way: depth and fun. Julia breast-fed them.
Jacob made them crack up with over-the-top versions of airplane-into-the-mouth
feeding. Julia had a visceral, uncontrollable need to check in on them while
they slept. Jacob woke them up if the game went into extra innings. Julia
taught them words like nostalgia, angst, and pensive. Jacob liked to say,
“There’s no bad language, only bad usage,” as a way of justifying the
supposedly good usage of words like douche and shitty, which Julia hated as
much as the kids loved.</p>

<p>There was another way of looking at
that dichotomy of depth and fun, one that Jacob had spent innumerable hours
considering with Dr. Silvers: heaviness and lightness. Julia brought weight to
everything, opening up a space for every intimated emotion, urging a
fleshed-out conversation about each passing remark, perpetually suggesting the
value of sadness. Jacob felt that most problems weren’t problems, and those
that were could be resolved with distraction, food, physical activity, or the
passage of time. Julia always wanted to give the kids a life of gravity:
culture, trips abroad, black-and-white movies. Jacob saw no problem with—saw
the great good in—bubblier, dumber activities: water parks, baseball games,
terrible superhero movies that brought great pleasure. She understood childhood
as the period of soul formation. He understood it as life’s only opportunity to
feel safe and happy. Each saw the myriad shortcomings and absolute necessity of
the other.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” Julia asked,
“however many years ago, when my friend Rachel came to our seder?”</p>

<p>“Rachel?”</p>

<p>“From architecture school?
Remember, she came with her twins?”</p>

<p>“And no husband.”</p>

<p>“Right. He’d had a heart attack at
the gym.”</p>

<p>“Cautionary tale.”</p>

<p>“You remember?”</p>

<p>“Sure, that year’s sympathy
invite.”</p>

<p>“I guess she went to yeshiva as a
girl, or had some kind of rigorous Jewish education. I hadn’t realized that,
and ended up feeling so embarrassed.”</p>

<p>“By what?”</p>

<p>“What illiterate Jews we are.”</p>

<p>“But she had a great time, didn’t
she?”</p>

<p>“She did.”</p>

<p>“So save your embarrassment.”</p>

<p>“It was years ago.”</p>

<p>“Embarrassment is the Parmalat of
emotions.”</p>

<p>That got a great laugh—it felt
great to Jacob—from Julia. An irrepressible laugh in the midst of so much
tactical strategizing.</p>

<p>“What made you remember her now?”</p>

<p>Silence can be as irrepressible as
laughter. And it can accumulate, like weightless snowflakes. It can collapse a
ceiling.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” Julia said.</p>

<p>Jacob tried to pitch the
conversation’s roof: “Maybe you were remembering how it felt to be judged.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. I don’t think she was
judging. But I felt judged.”</p>

<p>“And you’re afraid of feeling
judged?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>A few nights before, Julia had
awoken as if from a nightmare, although she had no memory of any dream. She
went down to the kitchen, found the Georgetown Day student directory in the
“crap drawer,” and confirmed that Benjy would be the only child in his class
with two addresses.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of our family being
judged,” she said.</p>

<p>“Do you judge yourself?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to be the sympathy
invite this year, aren’t I?”</p>

<p>Julia smiled, grateful for the
deflection.</p>

<p>“Why should this year be different
from all other years?”</p>

<p>Their first shared laugh in weeks.</p>

<p>Jacob wasn’t used to this warmth,
and it confused him. This was not what he was expecting when rehearsing for
this rehearsal of a conversation. He’d anticipated something subtly
passive-aggressive. He assumed he’d have to sample a buffet of shit, never
having the guts—never finding justification in the cost-benefit analysis of
self-defense—to draw upon the small arsenal of retorts he’d prepared.</p>

<p>Dr. Silvers had urged him simply to
be present, to sit with his pain (rather than send it back), and to resist the
desire for certain outcomes. But Jacob felt the situation would call for some
very un-Eastern responsiveness. He would have to avoid saying things that could
be used against him at any future point, as everything would be entered into
the permanent record. He would have to appear to yield (with gentle
affirmations, and declared reversals to positions he already secretly held),
without giving an inch. He would have to have the cunning of someone too
cunning to read a book about the cunning of samurai.</p>

<p>But as the conversation took shape,
Jacob felt no need for control. There was nothing to win; there was only losing
to protect against.</p>

<p>“‘There are many different kinds of
families,’” Julia said. “Doesn’t that seem like a good way to go?”</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“‘Some families have two dads. Some
have two moms.’”</p>

<p>“‘Some families live in two
houses’?”</p>

<p>“At which point Max will infer
we’re buying a vacation house, and get excited.”</p>

<p>“A vacation house?”</p>

<p>“A house on the ocean. ‘Some
families live in two houses: one in the city, one by the ocean.’”</p>

<p>A vacation house, Julia thought,
willfully confusing herself as completely as Max would. She and Jacob had
talked about it—not a house on the ocean, they could never afford that, but
something cozy and elsewhere. It was the big news she was going to mention to
Mark that day, before he reminded her how newsless her life was. A vacation
house would be nice. Maybe even nice enough to make things work for a while, or
to simulate a functioning family until the next temporary solution could be
found. The appearance of happiness. If they could sustain the appearance—not to
others, but how life appeared to themselves—it might be a close-enough
approximation of the experience of actual happiness to make things work.</p>

<p>They could travel more. The
planning of a trip, the trip, the decompression: that would buy them some time.</p>

<p>They could go to couples therapy,
but Jacob had implied a bizarre loyalty to Dr. Silvers, which would have made
seeing someone else a transgression (a greater transgression, apparently, than
requesting a shot of fecal cum from a woman who was not his wife); and when
Julia faced the prospect of opening everything up, the time and expense of
twice-a-week visits that would end in either painful silence or endless
talking, she couldn’t rouse herself to the necessary hopefulness.</p>

<p>They could have done exactly what
she’d spent her professional life facilitating and her personal life
condemning: a renovation. There was so much that could be improved in their
house: revamp the kitchen (new hardware, at minimum, but why not new
countertops, new appliances, ideally a reconfiguration for better flow and
lines of sight); new master bath; new closets; open up the back of the house to
the garden; punch in a couple of skylights above the top-floor showers; finish
the basement.</p>

<p>“‘One house where Mom will live,
and one house where Dad will live.’”</p>

<p>“OK,” Jacob said, “let me be Sam
for a minute.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to move at the same
time?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to try to, yes.”</p>

<p>“And I’m going to have to carry my
stuff back and forth every day?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to live within walking
distance of each other,” Julia said, “and it won’t be every day.”</p>

<p>“Is that really something you can
promise? I’m being me now.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s an OK promise for the
situation.”</p>

<p>“And how will we divide time?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Julia said, “but
not every day.”</p>

<p>“And who’s going to live here? I’m
being Sam again.”</p>

<p>“Hopefully a nice family.”</p>

<p>“We’re a nice family.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are.”</p>

<p>“Did one of you have an affair?”</p>

<p>“Jacob.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“He’s not going to ask that.”</p>

<p>“First of all, of course he might.
Second, it’s one of those things that, however unlikely, we absolutely need to
have a prepared answer for.”</p>

<p>“OK,” Julia said, “so I’ll be Sam.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“Did one of you have an affair?”</p>

<p>“Who am I?” Jacob asked. “Me? Or
you?”</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“No. That’s not what’s going on
here.”</p>

<p>“But I saw your phone.”</p>

<p>“Wait, did he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think so? Or he didn’t?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that he did.”</p>

<p>“So why are you saying it?”</p>

<p>“Because the kids know things that
we don’t think they know. And when he helped me to unlock it—”</p>

<p>“He helped you unlock it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know whose it was.”</p>

<p>“And he saw—?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him—”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>Jacob got back into the character
of himself.</p>

<p>“What you saw was an exchange with
one of the other writers on my show. We were sending lines back and forth for a
scene in which, well, two people say some pretty inappropriate things to each
other.”</p>

<p>“Convincing,” Julia said, herself.</p>

<p>“And you, Mom?” Jacob asked. “Did
you have an affair?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not with Mark Adelson?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t kiss him at Model UN?”</p>

<p>“Is this really productive, Jacob?”</p>

<p>“Here, I’ll be you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sam, I did kiss Mark at Model
UN. It wasn’t premeditated—”</p>

<p>“Not a word I would ever use.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t planned. It wasn’t even
enjoyable. It simply happened. I am sorry that it happened. I have asked your
father to accept my apology, and he has. Your father is a very good man—”</p>

<p>“We get the picture.”</p>

<p>“Really, though,” Jacob said, “how
are we going to explain our reasoning?”</p>

<p>“Reasoning?”</p>

<p>They never used the word divorce.
Jacob could bring himself to say it, because it wasn’t going to happen. But he
didn’t want it aboveground. Julia couldn’t say it, because she wasn’t so sure.
She didn’t know where to put it.</p>

<p>If Julia were to be fully honest,
she couldn’t easily say her reasons for doing what they couldn’t say. She was
unhappy, although unconvinced that her unhappiness wouldn’t be someone else’s
happiness. She felt unfulfilled desire—profound amounts of it—but presumably so
did every other married and unmarried person. She wanted more, but didn’t know
if there was more to be found. Not knowing used to feel inspiring. It felt like
faith. Now it felt agnostic. Like not knowing.</p>

<p>“What if they want to know if we’re
going to get remarried?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Are you?”</p>

<p>“Definitely not,” she said. “No
chance.”</p>

<p>“You’re awfully sure.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing I’m more sure
of.”</p>

<p>“You used to be so unsure of
everything, in the best way.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I used to have less
evidence.”</p>

<p>“The only thing you have evidence
of is that our specific way of doing things didn’t work for the specific person
you are.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready for the next chapter.”</p>

<p>“Spinsterhood?”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p>“What about Mark?”</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“He’s nice. Handsome. Why not give
that a try?”</p>

<p>“How can you be so ready to give me
away?”</p>

<p>“No. No, it’s just you seem to have
a connection with him, and—”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to worry about me,
Jacob. I’ll be fine.”</p>

<p>“I’m not worried about you.”</p>

<p>That didn’t sound right.</p>

<p>He tried again: “I’m not any more
worried about you than you are about me.”</p>

<p>Also not right.</p>

<p>“Mark is a mensch,” Billie said at
the edge of the room. Do they spontaneously generate from the upholstery, like
maggots from rotting meat?</p>

<p>“Billie?”</p>

<p>“Hello,” she said, extending her
hand to Jacob. “We haven’t actually met, although I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p>

<p>Precisely what? Jacob wanted to
ask, but instead took her hand and said, “And I’ve heard a lot about you.” A
lie. “All good things, by the way.” The truth.</p>

<p>“I was upstairs helping Sam with
his bar mitzvah apology, and it occurred to us that we don’t know what,
exactly, qualifies as an apology. Does an apology require an explicit
disavowal?”</p>

<p>Jacob shot Julia a look of check
out the vocabulary on this one.</p>

<p>“Could he simply describe what
happened and explain? Are the words I’m sorry strictly necessary?”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t Sam asking?”</p>

<p>“He’s walking Argus. And he asked
me to.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come up in a bit and help
out,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that’s necessary or,
really, wanted. We just kind of need to know what’s meant by apology.”</p>

<p>“I think an explicit disavowal is
required,” Julia said, “but no need for the words I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“That was my instinct,” Billie
said. “OK. Well, thanks.”</p>

<p>She turned to leave the room, and
Julia called her back: “Billie.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Did you hear any of the
conversation we were having? Or just that Mark is nice?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know if you heard
anything? Or you don’t know if you feel comfortable answering?”</p>

<p>“The latter.”</p>

<p>“It’s just that—”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t yet spoken with the
boys—”</p>

<p>“I really understand.”</p>

<p>“And there’s a lot of context,”
Jacob chimed in.</p>

<p>“My parents are divorced. I get
it.”</p>

<p>“We’re just finding our way,” Jacob
said, “just figuring things out.”</p>

<p>“Your parents are divorced?” Julia
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Two years ago.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame myself for their
divorce, and neither should you.”</p>

<p>“You’re funny,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“The divorce obviously didn’t get
in the way of you becoming an amazing person.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll never know what I
could have been otherwise.”</p>

<p>“You’re really funny.”</p>

<p>“I really thank you.”</p>

<p>“We know this puts you in an
awkward position,” Jacob added.</p>

<p>“It’s fine,” Billie said, and
turned to leave once again.</p>

<p>“Billie?” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Would you describe your parents’
divorce as a loss?”</p>

<p>“For whom?”</p>

<p>“I want to change my wish,” Benjy
said.</p>

<p>“Benjy?”</p>

<p>“I ought to go,” Billie said,
turning to leave.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to go,” Julia said.
“Stay.”</p>

<p>“I wished for you to believe Sam.”</p>

<p>“Believe him about what?” Jacob
said, gathering Benjy onto his knee.</p>

<p>“I ought to,” Billie said, and
headed up.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Benjy said. “I just
heard him talking to Max, and he said he wished you believed him. So I made his
wish my wish.”</p>

<p>“It’s not that we don’t believe
him,” Jacob said, re-finding his anger at Julia for being unable to take Sam’s
side.</p>

<p>“So what is it?”</p>

<p>“Do you want to know what Sam and
Max were talking about?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>Benjy nodded.</p>

<p>“Sam got in trouble in Hebrew
school because they found a piece of paper on his desk with some bad words on
it. He says he didn’t do it. His teacher is sure that he did.”</p>

<p>“So why don’t you believe him?”</p>

<p>“We don’t not believe him,” Jacob
said.</p>

<p>“We always want to believe him,”
Julia said. “We always want to take the side of our children. But we don’t
think Sam is telling the truth this time. That doesn’t make him a bad person.
And it doesn’t make us love him any less. This is how we love him. We’re trying
to help him. People make mistakes all the time. I make mistakes all the time.
Dad does. And we all count on each other’s forgiveness. But that requires an
apology. Good people don’t make fewer mistakes, they’re just better at
apologizing.”</p>

<p>Benjy thought about that.</p>

<p>He craned his neck to face Jacob,
and asked, “So why do you believe him?”</p>

<p>“Mom and I believe the same thing.”</p>

<p>“You also think he lied?”</p>

<p>“No, I also think people make
mistakes and deserve forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“But do you think he lied?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Benjy. And neither
does Mom. Only Sam knows.”</p>

<p>“But do you think he lied?”</p>

<p>Jacob put his palms on Benjy’s
thighs and waited for the angel to call out. But no angel. And no ram. Jacob
said, “We think he isn’t telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“Could you call Mr. Schneiderman
and ask him to change my note?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Jacob said, “we can do
that.”</p>

<p>“But how would you tell him my new
wish without saying it?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you just write it and
give it to him?”</p>

<p>“He’s already there.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“The Wailing Wall.”</p>

<p>“In Israel?”</p>

<p>“I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then don’t worry. I’m sure his
trip was canceled and you’ll have a chance to change your wish.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because of the earthquake.”</p>

<p>“What earthquake?”</p>

<p>“There was an earthquake in Israel
last week.”</p>

<p>“A big one?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t heard us talking about
it?”</p>

<p>“You talk about lots of things that
you don’t talk about to me. Is the Wall going to be OK?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“If anything’s going to be OK,”
Jacob added, “it’s the Wall. It’s been OK for more than two thousand years.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but there used to be three
other walls.”</p>

<p>“There’s a great story about that,”
Jacob said, hoping he would be able to remember what he’d just promised to
deliver. The story had lain dormant since he was told it in Hebrew school. He
couldn’t remember the telling, and he hadn’t thought about it since, yet there
it was, a part of him—a part to be handed down. “When the Roman army conquered
Jerusalem, the order was given to destroy the Temple.”</p>

<p>“It was the Second Temple,” Benjy
said, “because the first was destroyed.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Good for you for
knowing that. Anyway, three of the walls went down, but the fourth one
resisted.”</p>

<p>“Resisted?”</p>

<p>“Struggled. Fought back.”</p>

<p>“A wall can’t fight back.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t be destroyed.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“It stood firm against hammers, and
pickaxes, and clubs. The Romans had elephants push against the wall, they tried
to set fire to it, they even invented the wrecking ball.”</p>

<p>“Cool.”</p>

<p>“But nothing, it seemed, would
bring the fourth wall down. The soldier in charge of the Temple’s destruction
reported back to his commanding officer that they had destroyed three of the
Temple’s walls. But instead of admitting that they couldn’t knock down the
fourth one, he suggested they leave it up.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“As proof of their greatness.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get it.”</p>

<p>“When people would see the wall,
they would be able to conjure the immensity of the Temple, the foe they
defeated.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Julia clarified: “They would see
how huge the actual Temple must have been.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Benjy said, taking it in.</p>

<p>Jacob turned to Julia. “Isn’t there
some organization rebuilding destroyed synagogues in Europe from their
foundations? It’s like that.”</p>

<p>“Or the 9/11 Memorial.”</p>

<p>“There’s a word for it. I heard it
once … A shul. Right, shul.”</p>

<p>“Like synagogue?”</p>

<p>“Wonderful coincidence, but no.
It’s Tibetan.”</p>

<p>“Where would you have learned a
Tibetan word?”</p>

<p>“No idea,” Jacob said. “But I
learned it.”</p>

<p>“So? Are you going to make us pull
down the Tibetan Webster’s?”</p>

<p>“I could be getting this wrong, but
I think it’s a physical impression left behind. Like a footprint. Or the
channel where water flowed. Or in Connecticut—the matted grass where Argus had
slept.”</p>

<p>“A snow angel,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“That’s a great one,” Julia said,
reaching for his face.</p>

<p>“Only, we don’t believe in angels.”</p>

<p>Jacob touched Benjy’s knee. “What I
said was that while there are angels in the Torah, Judaism doesn’t really
encourage—”</p>

<p>“You’re my angel,” Julia told
Benjy.</p>

<p>“And you’re actually my tooth
fairy,” he said.</p>

<p>Jacob’s wish would have been to
have learned his life lessons before it was too late to apply them. But like
the wall into which he’d have tucked it, the wish conjured an immensity.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>After Benjy had left the room, and
the rehearsal had wrapped up, and Max was fed a second dinner that wasn’t spinach
lasagna, and the door separating Sam and Billie from the rest of the world was
judged sufficiently cracked, Jacob decided to go run some unnecessary errands
at the hardware store: buy a shorter hose that would tuck away less awkwardly,
replenish the AAA battery supply, maybe fondle some power tools. On his way, he
called his father.</p>

<p>“I give in,” he said.</p>

<p>“Are you on Bluetooth?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, get off it, so I can hear
you.”</p>

<p>“It’s illegal to hold the phone
while driving.”</p>

<p>“And it gives you cancer, too. Cost
of doing business.”</p>

<p>Jacob brought the phone to his face
and repeated, “I give in.”</p>

<p>“That’s great to hear. With
reference to what?”</p>

<p>“Let’s bury Grandpa here.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Irv asked, sounding
surprised, and pleased, and heartbroken. “What brought that on?”</p>

<p>The reason—whether he was persuaded
by his father’s pragmatism, or was tired of reorganizing his life to spend time
with a dead body, or was too preoccupied with the burial of his family to keep
up the fight—simply didn’t matter all that much. It took them eight days, but
the decision was made: they would bury Isaac in Judean Gardens, a very
ordinary, pretty-enough cemetery about thirty minutes outside the city. He
would get visitors, and spend eternity among his family, and while it might not
be the nonexistent and tarrying Messiah’s first or thousandth stop, He’d get
there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE GENUINE VERSION</h2>

<p>Eyesick, the threadbare beginnings
of an avatar, was in the middle of a digital lemon grove—the clearly marked and
barbed-wire-ringed private property of a lemonade corporation that used kinda
funny videos, featuring kinda trustworthy actors, to persuade
concerned-but-not-motivated consumers to believe that what they were drinking
had something to do with authenticity. Sam hated such corporations nearly half
as much as he hated himself for being just another spoon-fed idiot-cog who
grinned and whatever the past tense of “bear it” is while hating, and
announcing his hatred of, corporations. He would never trespass in life itself.
He was too ethical, and too much of a coward. (Sometimes it was hard to
differentiate.) But that was one of the many, many great things about Other
Life—perhaps the explanation for his addiction to it: it was an opportunity to
be a little less ethical, and a little less of a coward.</p>

<p>Eyesick was trespassing, yes, but
he wasn’t there to start a fire, chop down trees, do graffiti (or whatever is
the proper way of saying that), or even to trespass, really. He’d gone there to
be alone. Among the seemingly infinite columns of trunks, beneath the duvet of
lemons, he could be by himself. It’s not like he felt a great need to be alone.
Need was a word that Sam’s mom might use.</p>

<p>“Do you need to get any homework
done before we go to dinner?”</p>

<p>“Finished,” he would say, taking
great pleasure in throwing the correction back at her.</p>

<p>“Do you need to get any homework
finished before we go to dinner?”</p>

<p>“Need?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Need.”</p>

<p>He took no pleasure in the great
pleasure he seemed to take in being a smart-ass with her. But he needed to do
it. He needed to push back against his instinct to cling to her; he needed to
alienate what he needed to draw close, but more than anything, he needed not to
be the object of her needs. It was bodily. It wasn’t her continued need to kiss
him that repulsed him, but her overt efforts to manage that need. He was
disgusted—revolted, nauseated—by her stolen touches: fixing his hair for a
moment longer than necessary, holding his hand while cutting his fingernails
(something he knew how to do himself, but needed her to do, but only in exactly
the right and limited way). And her stolen glances: when he was coming out of a
pool, or worse, taking off a shirt for an impromptu load of laundry. What she
stole was stolen from him, and it inspired not only disgust, and not only
auger, but resistance. You can have what you want, but you cannot take it.</p>

<p>Eyesick was seeking aloneness in a
lemon grove because Sam was sitting shiva for Isaac, avoiding conversations
with relatives whose central processing units were programmed to shame him. Why
else would a second cousin he hadn’t seen in years feel a need to mention acne?
To mention voice-dropping? To wink while asking about girlfriends?</p>

<p>Eyesick was seeking aloneness. Not
to be by himself, but to be away from others. It’s different.</p>

<p>&gt; Sam?</p>

<p>&gt; …</p>

<p>&gt; Sam, is that you?</p>

<p>&gt; Who are you talking to?</p>

<p>&gt; YOU.</p>

<p>&gt; Me?</p>

<p>&gt; You. Sam.</p>

<p>&gt; Who are you?</p>

<p>&gt; I KNEW it was you.</p>

<p>&gt; Who knew?</p>

<p>&gt; You don’t recognize me?</p>

<p>Recognize? The avatar addressing
Eyesick was a lion with a plush rainbow mane; a brown suede vest with
opalescent buttons, largely concealed beneath a white tuxedo with tails down to
the end of his tail (which was itself adorned with a cubic zirconia heart);
bleached teeth largely concealed by lipsticked lips (insofar as a lion has
lips); a snout that was just a bit too moist; ruby pupils (not ruby-colored,
but gemstones); and mother-of-pearl claws with peace signs and Stars of David
etched into them. If it was good, it was very good. But was it good?</p>

<p>There was no recognition. Only the
surprise of having been discovered in a moment of reflection, and the shame of
having been named and known.</p>

<p>It would be possible, in theory,
for someone with sufficient tech savvy and insufficient joie de vivre to trace
Eyesick back to Sam. But it would require an effort that he couldn’t imagine
anyone he knew—anyone who knew him—making. Except maybe Billie.</p>

<p>Putting aside his parents’
virtuosically lame and quarter-hearted attempts to “check in” on his computer
usage, it never ceased to amaze Sam what he could get away with.</p>

<p>Proof: he shoplifted from the
corner grocery that still had his family name above the door, the store his
great-grandfather had opened with more dead brothers than words of English. Sam
shoplifted enough junk food—enough bags of Cheetos (punctured with the
sharpened end of a bent paper clip to release the air and allow for
compression), enough Mentos boners in his pockets—from the earnest Korean
immigrants, who kept lemon slices by the register to keep their fingers moist
enough to grip cash, to open his own corner store, but this one with a
different name, preferably with no name, preferably: STORE. Why did he do all
that stealing? Not to eat what he took. He never did, never once. He always,
always returned the goods—the returning requiring far more illicit prowess than
the stealing. He did it to prove that he could, and to prove that he was horrible,
and to prove that no one cared.</p>

<p>Proof: the volume (in terabytes) of
porn he consumed, and the volume (in quarts) of semen he disseminated. Under
their noses might be an unfortunate turn of phrase, but how could so-called
parents be so completely oblivious to the mass grave being dug and filled with
sperm in their own backyard?</p>

<p>The shiva reminded him of many
things—the mortality of his grandparents and parents, his own mortality and
Argus’s, how undeniably comforting it can be to perform rituals you don’t
understand—but nothing more than the first time he jerked off, also at a shiva.
It was his great-aunt Doris’s funeral reception. Though they referred to her as
Great-Aunt Doris, her relationship was more distant, involving at least some
once-removeds. (And it had been suggested, by his grandfather, after a few
glasses of very expensive vodka, that she wasn’t a blood relative at all.)
Whatever the case, she’d never married, and had no children, and flaunted her
loneliness to sidle up closer to the trunk of the family tree.</p>

<p>The familiar gathering of
unfamiliar family noshed away, and like Moses receiving the call to a needy
bush, Sam galloped to his bathroom. Somehow he understood it was the moment,
even if he didn’t understand the method. He used hair gel that day, because it
was nearby and viscous. The more he slid his fist up and down his shaft, the
stronger was his suspicion that something of genuine significance was
happening—not just pleasurable, but mystical. It felt better and better, he
squeezed harder, and then it felt even better, and then, with one small thrust
for man, mankind leaped giantly across the canyon separating crappy, pathetic,
inauthentic life from the unself-conscious, unangry, unawkward realm he wanted
to spend the rest of his days and nights on earth inhabiting. Out of his penis
gushed a substance he would have to admit he loved more than he loved any
person in his life, more than any idea, loved so much that it became his enemy.
Sometimes, in less proud moments, he would even talk to his sperm as his semen
congealed in his belly button. Sometimes he would look it in the hundred
million eyes and say simply: “Enemies.”</p>

<p>The first time was a revelation.
The first several thousand times. He jerked off again that afternoon, and again
and again that night. He jerked off with the determination of someone within
sight of Everest’s summit, having lost all his friends and Sherpas, having run
out of supplemental oxygen, but preferring death to failure. He used hair gel
every time, never questioning the potential dermatological effects of
repeatedly applying to his penis a substance intended to sculpt hair. By the
third day, his pubes were pipe cleaners and his shaft was leprous.</p>

<p>So he started jerking off with
aloe. But the green was cognitively dissonant, made him feel like he was
fucking an alien, but in a bad way. So he switched to moisturizer.</p>

<p>He was a mad-scientist masturbator,
always searching for ways to make his hand more like a vagina. It would have
helped to have had a bona fide experience with a bona fide vagina, but his
inability not to hear “boner fide” made the chances of that as nugatory as did
his use of the word nugatory. Anyway, the Internet was nothing if not a
gynecological resource, and anyway, there were things one knew without having
had a way to know, like how babies won’t crawl off a cliff—a fact he was
ninety-five percent sure of. When, five infinitely and cosmically unjustly long
years later, he had his first sexual experience with a corporeal female—not
Billie, tragically, but someone merely nice and smart and pretty—he was
surprised by just how accurate his imaginings had been. He’d known all along,
he’d known everything. Perhaps if he’d known that he’d known, those years would
have been slightly easier to endure.</p>

<p>He used his dry fist, his fist
lubricated with: honey, or shampoo, or Vaseline, or shaving cream, or rice
pudding, or toothpaste (only once), or the remnants of the tube of A&amp;D that
his parents couldn’t bring themselves to throw away, despite being able to throw
away everything that actually mattered. He made an artificial vagina out of a
toilet paper roll, covering one end with Saran wrap (held down with rubber
bands), filling the tube with maple syrup, then covering the other end with
Saran wrap (and more rubber bands) and giving it a slit. He fucked pillows,
blankets, swimming pool vacuums, stuffed animals. He jerked off to the
Victoria’s Secret catalog, and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, and the
back-page ads in the City Paper, and JCPenney bra advertisements in Parade
magazine, and basically anything that could, with the far reaches of his
all-powerful and highly motivated imagination, be construed to be an asshole,
vagina, nipple, or mouth (in that order). Of course, he had unlimited access to
more free porn than could be watched over the course of the lifetimes of every
citizen of China, but even an anus-crazed twelve-year-old appreciates the
correlation between the mental work required and the magnitude of the nut,
hence his ultimate fantasy of intercepting some Arab virgin on her way to get
fucked by an actual martyr, tucking his head under her burka, and, in that
deep-space, sensory-deprived blackness, licking orbits around Heranus. Would
anyone ever believe that this had nothing to do with religion, or ethnicity, or
even taboo?</p>

<p>He tied rubber bands around his
wrist—rubber bands being to masturbation what flour is to baking—to make his
fingers go numb so he would no longer recognize them as his own. It worked
terrifically well, and he almost lost his hand. He angled mirrors in such a way
as to see his asshole without the rest of his body, and was able to convince
himself that it was the asshole of a woman who wanted him in her asshole. He
masturbated with his dominant and his recessive hand—his intact and his mangled
hand—and rubbed Indian burns into his shaft with both hands at once. For
several months he favored what he called—called to no one, of course—the “Roger
Ebert grip”: a half twist of the wrist, so that the thumb was pointing down.
(For reasons he didn’t understand, and felt no need to understand, this also
gave the impression of his hand being someone else’s hand.) He closed his eyes
and held his breath until he started to black out. He fucked the soles of his
feet like some kind of horndog maharishi. If he were actually trying to detach
his penis from his body, he couldn’t have squeezed or pulled it any harder, and
it’s a miracle he never actually hurt himself, although even when he was
pleasuring himself, he felt that, in some deep and irreparable way, he was
hurting himself, that it had to be so, and that that was another elemental bit
of knowledge with which he was born.</p>

<p>He masturbated in Amtrak bathrooms,
plane bathrooms, the bathrooms of his school and Hebrew school, bookstore
bathrooms, Gap and Zara and H&amp;M bathrooms, restaurant bathrooms, the
bathrooms of every house he’d been in since gaining the ability to come into a
toilet. If it flushed, he fucked it.</p>

<p>How many times did he try to suck
his own dick? (Like Tantalus, as he reached, so did the fruit pull away.) He
tried to fuck his own asshole, but that required pushing his boner in the
direction it most didn’t want to go, like a drawbridge being forced to touch
the water. He was able to rub his scrotum around his asshole, but that only
made him melancholy.</p>

<p>He once stumbled upon a
sufficiently compelling argument, in an analingus community, for sticking his
finger into his butt while jerking off. Once he’d trained his sphincter to stop
reflexively impersonating a Chinese finger trap, it felt pretty good, if pretty
strange. It felt like being a bowl whose rim was being wiped clean of cookie
batter by the finger of someone—namely: him—who couldn’t wait. He was, indeed,
able to find his prostate, and as promised, he saw through walls when he came.
But there was nothing to see except the next crappy room. It was the removal of
his finger that ruined everything. First of all, immediately after coming,
everything that seemed not only good but logical, necessary, and inevitable
before coming instantly seems inexplicable, deranged, and repugnant. It’s
possible to play down, or even deny, almost anything you just said or did, but
a finger in one’s butthole cannot be played down or denied. It can only be left
there or removed. And it cannot be left there.</p>

<p>Sam never felt comfortable in his
body—not in clothing that never fit, not when performing his ridiculous
impression of a nonspastic walker—except when masturbating. When masturbating,
he both owned and existed in his body. He was effortless, a natural, himself.</p>

<p>&gt; It’s ME.</p>

<p>&gt; That doesn’t help. And stop
abusing caps.</p>

<p>&gt; it’s me.</p>

<p>&gt; Billie?</p>

<p>&gt; Billie?</p>

<p>&gt; Max?</p>

<p>&gt; No.</p>

<p>&gt; Great-Grandpa?</p>

<p>&gt; NOAM.</p>

<p>&gt; Stop shouting.</p>

<p>&gt; noam. your cousin.</p>

<p>&gt; My Israeli cousin Noam?</p>

<p>&gt; No, your Swedish cousin Noam.</p>

<p>&gt; Funny.</p>

<p>&gt; And Israeli.</p>

<p>&gt; Your dad and little brother
are here.</p>

<p>&gt; I know. My dad sent me an
e-mail from the cemetery.</p>

<p>&gt; That’s weird. He said he
couldn’t contact you guys.</p>

<p>&gt; He probably meant by phone. We
e-mail all the time.</p>

<p>&gt; We’re sitting shiva at my
grandfather’s house.</p>

<p>&gt; Yes, I know that, too. He
e-mailed me a picture of the salmon.</p>

<p>&gt; Why?</p>

<p>&gt; Because it was there. And
because the world lacks reality for him until he photographs it with his phone.</p>

<p>&gt; You speak English better than
me.</p>

<p>&gt; “Better than I do.”</p>

<p>&gt; Right.</p>

<p>&gt; Anyway, I wanted to tell you
whatever is the genuine version of “I am sorry for your loss.”</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t believe in genuine
versions.</p>

<p>&gt; I wish you less sadness. How
about that?</p>

<p>&gt; How did you find me?</p>

<p>&gt; The same way you would have
found me if you were looking. Not hard.</p>

<p>&gt; I didn’t know you were in
Other Life.</p>

<p>&gt; I used to spend most of every
day here. But I’ve never been in this grove before.</p>

<p>&gt; I’ve never been in this grove
before, either.</p>

<p>&gt; Do you like it when people
unnecessarily repeat bits of speech? Like you just did? You could have said,
“Me, neither,” but you took what I said and made it your own. I said, “I’ve
never been in this grove before,” and you said, “I’ve never been in this grove
before, either.”</p>

<p>&gt; I do like it when people
unnecessarily repeat bits of speech.</p>

<p>&gt; If I used emoticons, I would
have used one here.</p>

<p>&gt; I’m glad you don’t.</p>

<p>&gt; There isn’t time for Other
Life in the army.</p>

<p>&gt; Too much real life?</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t believe in real life.</p>

<p>&gt;;)</p>

<p>&gt; I really let myself go. Look
at my nails.</p>

<p>&gt; Look at you? Look at me! I
still have placenta on my face.</p>

<p>&gt;???</p>

<p>&gt; My dad committed avataricide.</p>

<p>&gt; Why?</p>

<p>&gt; He accidentally sniffed a
Bouquet of Fatality.</p>

<p>&gt; Why?</p>

<p>&gt; Because he wears his sphincter
like a necklace, and it choked blood flow to his brain. Anyway, I’m in the
process of rebuilding myself, and I’m not exactly satisfied with my progress.</p>

<p>&gt; You look … old.</p>

<p>&gt; Yeah. I kinda became my
great-grandfather.</p>

<p>&gt; Why?</p>

<p>&gt; Same reason I will in real
life, I guess? I mean, this life.</p>

<p>&gt; Do you need some resilience
fruit?</p>

<p>&gt; A few hundred thousand
wouldn’t hurt.</p>

<p>&gt; I can give you mine.</p>

<p>&gt; I was kidding.</p>

<p>&gt; I wasn’t.</p>

<p>&gt; Why would you do that?</p>

<p>&gt; Because you need them and I
don’t. Do you want 250,000?</p>

<p>&gt; 250,000!</p>

<p>&gt; Stop shouting.</p>

<p>&gt; That must have taken you a
year.</p>

<p>&gt; Or three.</p>

<p>&gt; I can’t accept that.</p>

<p>&gt; Sure you can. A bar mitzvah
present.</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t even know if I’m
having one.</p>

<p>&gt; A bar mitzvah isn’t something
you have. It’s something you become.</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t even know if I’m
becoming one.</p>

<p>&gt; Do babies know they’re born?</p>

<p>&gt; They cry.</p>

<p>&gt; So cry.</p>

<p>&gt; Where are you?</p>

<p>&gt; At home for another couple of
hours.</p>

<p>&gt; I thought you were somewhere
dangerous.</p>

<p>&gt; You’ve met my mother.</p>

<p>&gt; Your dad said you were in the
West Bank.</p>

<p>&gt; I was. But I came back the day
before the earthquake.</p>

<p>&gt; Shit, I can’t believe we’ve
talked for this long and I haven’t yet asked how you’re doing. I suck. I’m
sorry.</p>

<p>&gt; It’s OK. Remember, I found
you.</p>

<p>&gt; I suck.</p>

<p>&gt; I’m safe. We’re all safe.</p>

<p>&gt; What would have happened if
you’d still been in the West Bank?</p>

<p>&gt; I really don’t know.</p>

<p>&gt; Guess.</p>

<p>&gt; Why?</p>

<p>&gt; Because I’m curious.</p>

<p>&gt; Well, if we’d been stuck there
during the earthquake, I suppose we would have had to create a temporary base
of some kind and wait to be rescued.</p>

<p>&gt; What kind of base?</p>

<p>&gt; Whatever kind we could put
together. Maybe occupy a building.</p>

<p>&gt; Surrounded by people who want
to kill you?</p>

<p>&gt; What else is new?</p>

<p>&gt; They would have lobbed shit at
you?</p>

<p>&gt; Shit?</p>

<p>&gt; Grenades or whatever.</p>

<p>&gt; There is no “grenades or
whatever.” Weapons are precise.</p>

<p>&gt; Right.</p>

<p>&gt; Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe they
would have been preoccupied with their own problems.</p>

<p>&gt; It wouldn’t have been good.</p>

<p>&gt; There is no scenario in which
it would have been good.</p>

<p>&gt; What scenario would have been
worst?</p>

<p>Like his dad, Sam was drawn to
worst-case scenarios. It was obvious why they thrilled him, but hard to explain
the comfort they offered. Perhaps they mapped a distance from his own safe
life. Or perhaps coming to terms with the most horrible outcomes allowed for a
kind of mental preparation and resignation. Maybe they were just more sharp
objects—like the videos he hated and needed—to allow his insides out.</p>

<p>When he was in sixth grade, his
Hebrew school class was made to watch a documentary about the concentration
camps. It was never clear to him if this was because his teacher was lazy (an
acceptable way to get rid of a couple of hours), or unable or unwilling to
teach the material, or felt the impossibility of teaching it in any way other
than simply showing it. Even at the time, Sam felt that he was too young to be
seeing such a thing.</p>

<p>They sat at chipboard desks for
righties, and the teacher—whose name they will all be able to remember for the
rest of their lives—muttered a few unmemorable words of context and inspiration
and disclaimer, and pressed Play. They watched lines of naked women, many
pressing children to their chests. They were crying—the mothers and the
children—but why were they only crying? Why were they so orderly? So good? Why
didn’t the mothers run? Why didn’t they try to save their children’s lives? Why
didn’t they protect their children? Better to get shot running away than simply
walk to one’s death. A minuscule chance is infinitely greater than no chance.</p>

<p>The still-children watched from
their desks; they saw men digging their own mass graves and then kneeling in
them, their fingers interlaced behind their heads. Why did they dig their own
graves? If you’re going to be killed anyway, why help with the killing? For the
few extra moments of life? That might make sense. But how did they maintain
that composure? Because they thought it might buy them a few extra moments of
life? Maybe. A minuscule chance is infinitely greater than no chance, but a
moment of life is an eternity. Be a good Jewish boy and dig a good Jewish grave
and kneel like a mensch and, as Sam’s nursery school teacher, Judy Shore, used
to say, “You get what you get, and you don’t get upset.”</p>

<p>They saw grainy montages of humans
who had become science experiments—dead twins, Sam could not not remember,
still clutching each other on a table. Did they cling like that in life? He
could not not wonder.</p>

<p>They saw images from the liberated
camps: piles of hundreds or thousands of skeletal bodies, knees and elbows
bending the wrong way, arms and legs at wrong angles, eyes so deeply sunken
they could not be seen. Hills of bodies. Bulldozers testing a child’s belief
that a dead body doesn’t feel anything.</p>

<p>What was he left with? The
knowledge that Germans were—are—evil, evil, evil, not only capable of ripping
children from their mothers and then ripping their small bodies apart, but
eager to; that had non-Germans not intervened, the Germans would have murdered
every single Jewish man, woman, and child on the planet; and that of course his
grandfather was absolutely right, even if he sounded insane, when he said a
Jewish person should never buy a German product of any kind or size, never put
money into a German pocket, never visit Germany, never not cringe at the sound
of that vile language of savages, never have any more interaction than what
simply could not be avoided with any German of any age. Inscribe that on the
doorpost of your house and on your gate.</p>

<p>Or he was left with the knowledge
that everything that has happened once can happen again, is likely to happen
again, must happen again, will.</p>

<p>Or the knowledge that his life was,
if not the result of, then at least inextricably bound to, the profound
suffering, and that there was some kind of existential equation, whatever it
was and whatever its implications, between his life and their deaths.</p>

<p>Or no knowledge, but a feeling.
What feeling? What was that feeling?</p>

<p>Sam didn’t mention to his parents
what he’d seen. Didn’t seek explanation, or comfort. And he was given plenty of
guidance—almost all of it unintentional and extremely subtle—never to ask about
it, never even to acknowledge it. So it was never mentioned, always never
talked about, the perpetual topic of nonconversation. Everywhere you looked,
there it wasn’t.</p>

<p>His dad was obsessed with displays
of optimism, and the imagined accumulation of property, and joke-making; his
mom, with physical contact before saying goodbye, and fish oil, and outer
garments, and “the right thing to do”; Max, with extreme empathy and
self-imposed alienation; Benjy, with metaphysics and basic safety. And he, Sam,
was always longing. What was that feeling? It had something to do with
loneliness (his own and others’), something with suffering (his own and
others’), something with shame (his own and others’), something with fear (his
own and others’). But also something with stubborn belief, and stubborn
dignity, and stubborn joy. And yet it wasn’t really any of those things, or the
sum of them. It was the feeling of being Jewish. But what was that feeling?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE HARD TO SAY TODAY</h2>

<p>Israel continued to describe the
situation as manageable, but it also continued to close off its airspace, which
left tens of thousands of Israelis stranded on vacation and prevented Jews who
wanted to help from coming. Tamir tried hitching a ride on a Red Cross cargo
plane, tried getting special clearance through the military attaché at the
embassy, looked into chaperoning a shipment of construction equipment. But
there was no way home. He might have been the only person grateful to be at the
funeral—it gave him a few hours to rest in peace.</p>

<p>Sam wore his ill-fitting bar
mitzvah suit to the cemetery. Wearing it was the only thing he hated more than
the process of getting it: the torture chamber of mirrors, his mother’s
unhelpful help, the functionally pedophiliac survivor tailor who not once, not
twice, but three times groped at Sam’s crotch with his Parkinsonian fingers and
said, “Plenty of room.”</p>

<p>Tamir and Barak wore slacks with
short-sleeve button-up shirts—their uniform for every occasion, whether it was
going to synagogue, the grocery store, a Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball game, or
the funeral of the family patriarch. They viewed any kind of formality—in
dress, in speech, in affect—as some kind of gross infringement on a God-given
right to at all times be oneself. Jacob found it obnoxious, and enviable.</p>

<p>Jacob wore a black suit with a box
of Altoids in the pocket: artifacts of a time when he cared enough about how
his breath smelled to attempt to echo it off his palm for sniffs.</p>

<p>Julia wore a vintage A.P.C. dress
she’d found on Etsy for the equivalent of nothing. It wasn’t exactly funeral
attire, but she never had occasion to wear it, and she wanted to wear it, and
since the neutering of the bar mitzvah, a funeral was as glamorous an occasion
as she was going to get.</p>

<p>“You look beautiful, Julia,” she
said to Jacob, hating herself for saying it.</p>

<p>“Very beautiful,” Jacob said,
hating her for saying it, but also surprised that his assessment of her beauty
continued to matter to her.</p>

<p>“The impact is lessened by it
having been prompted.”</p>

<p>“It’s a funeral, Julia. And thank
you.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“For saying I look handsome.”</p>

<p>Irv wore the same suit he’d been
wearing since the Six-Day War.</p>

<p>Isaac wore the shroud in which he
had been married, the shroud he’d worn once a year on the Day of Atonement, the
chest of which he’d beaten with his fist: For the sin which we have committed
before You with an utterance on the lips … For the sin which we have committed
before You openly or secretly … For the sin which we have committed before You
by a confused heart … The shroud had no pockets, as the dead are required to be
buried without any encumbrances.</p>

<p>A small—in number and physical
stature—army from Adas Israel had passed through the grief like a breeze: they brought
stools, covered the mirrors, took care of the platters, and sent Jacob an
un-itemized bill that he was unable to question without requiring Jewish
seppuku. There would be a small service, followed by burial at Judean Gardens,
followed by a small kiddush at Irv and Deborah’s, followed by eternity.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>All the local cousins were at the
funeral, and a few older, zanier Jews came in from New York, Philly, and
Chicago. Jacob had met these people throughout his life, but only at rites of
passage—bar mitzvahs, weddings, funerals. He didn’t know their names, but their
faces evoked a kind of Pavlovian existentialism: if you’re here, if I see you,
something significant must be happening.</p>

<p>Rabbi Auerbach, who’d known Isaac
for several decades, had a stroke a month earlier and so left the officiating
to his replacement: a young, disheveled, smart, or maybe dumb recent product of
wherever rabbis are made. He wore unlaced sneakers, which felt, to Jacob, like
a shabby tribute to someone who had probably eaten sneakers in the skyless
forests of Poland. Then again, it might have been some kind of religious
display of reverence, like sitting on stools or covering mirrors.</p>

<p>He approached Jacob and Irv before
the service began.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for your loss,” he said,
cupping his hands in front of him, as if they contained empathy, or wisdom, or
emptiness.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Irv said.</p>

<p>“There are a few ritualistic—”</p>

<p>“Save your words. We’re not a
religious family.”</p>

<p>“It probably depends on what is
meant by religious,” the rabbi said.</p>

<p>“It probably doesn’t,” Jacob
corrected him, either in his dad’s defense or in the absence of God’s.</p>

<p>“And our stance is a choice,” Irv
said. “Not laziness, not assimilation, not inertia.”</p>

<p>“I respect that,” the rabbi said.</p>

<p>“We’re as good as any Jews.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’re better than most.”</p>

<p>Irv went right back at the rabbi:
“What you do or don’t respect isn’t of great importance to me.”</p>

<p>“I respect that, too,” the rabbi
said. “You’re a man of strongly held beliefs.”</p>

<p>Irv turned to Jacob: “This guy
really can’t take an insult.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” Jacob said. “It’s time.”</p>

<p>The rabbi walked the two of them
through a few of the small rituals that, while entirely voluntary, they would
be expected to perform in order to ensure Isaac’s proper passage into whatever
Jews believe in. After his initial reluctance, Irv seemed not only willing, but
wanting, to cross his chets and dot his zayins—as if stating his resistance was
resistance enough. He didn’t believe in God. He couldn’t, even if opening
himself to that foolishness might have opened him to badly needed comfort.
There had been a few moments—not of belief, but religiosity—every one of them
involving Jacob. When Deborah went into labor, Irv prayed to no one that she
and the baby would be safe. When Jacob was born, he prayed to no one that his
son long outlive him, and acquire more knowledge and self-knowledge than him,
and experience greater happiness. At Jacob’s bar mitzvah, Irv stood at the ark
and said a prayer of gratitude to no one that trembled, then broke, then
exploded into something so beautifully unrestrained and full-throated that he
was left with no voice to deliver his speech at the party. When he and Deborah
didn’t read the books they were staring at in the waiting room of George
Washington Hospital, and Jacob almost pushed the doors off the hinges, his face
covered in tears, his scrubs covered in blood, and did his best to form the
words “You have a grandson,” Irv closed his eyes, but not to darkness, and said
a prayer to no one without any content, only force. The sum of those no ones
was the King of the Universe. He’d spent enough of his life wrestling
foolishness. Now, at the cemetery, all the wrestling felt foolish.</p>

<p>The rabbi said a small prayer,
offering no translation or approximate sense of the meaning, and took a razor
blade to Irv’s lapel.</p>

<p>“I need this suit for my grandson’s
bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>Because he didn’t hear Irv, or
because he did, the young rabbi made a tiny incision, and directed Irv to open
it—to create the actual rip—with his forefingers. It was ridiculous, this
gesture. It was witchcraft, a relic from the time of stoning women for having
their periods the wrong way, and it was an unconscionable thing to do to a
Brooks Brothers suit. But Irv wanted to bury his father according to Jewish law
and tradition.</p>

<p>He inserted his fingers into the
incision, as if into his own chest, and pulled. And as the fabric tore, Irv’s
tears were released. Jacob hadn’t seen his father cry in years. He couldn’t
remember the last time he’d seen his father cry. It suddenly seemed possible
that he’d never seen him cry.</p>

<p>Irv looked at his son and
whispered, “I don’t have parents anymore.”</p>

<p>The rabbi said that now was the
moment, before the casket was taken from the hearse, for Irv to forgive his
father, and to ask for forgiveness.</p>

<p>“It’s OK,” Irv said, dismissing the
offer.</p>

<p>“I know,” the rabbi said.</p>

<p>“We’ve said everything that needed
to be said.”</p>

<p>“Do it anyway,” the rabbi
suggested.</p>

<p>“I think it’s foolish to speak to a
dead person.”</p>

<p>“Do it anyway. I wouldn’t want you
to regret missing this last chance.”</p>

<p>“He’s dead. It doesn’t matter to
him.”</p>

<p>“You’re living,” the rabbi said.</p>

<p>Irv shook his head, and continued
to shake it, but the object of the dismissiveness shifted: from the ritual to
his inability to participate.</p>

<p>He turned to Jacob and said, “I’m
sorry.”</p>

<p>“You realize I’m not the dead one.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. But both of us will be at
some point. And here we are.”</p>

<p>“Sorry for what?”</p>

<p>“An apology is only an apology if
it’s complete. I’m sorry for everything that I need to apologize for. No
context.”</p>

<p>“I thought we’d be monsters without
context.”</p>

<p>“We’re monsters either way.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, well, I’m a schmuck, too.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I was a schmuck.”</p>

<p>“OK, so I’m the schmuck.”</p>

<p>Irv put his hand on Jacob’s cheek
and almost smiled.</p>

<p>“Let’s get this party started,” he
said to the rabbi, and approached the back of the hearse.</p>

<p>He tentatively put his hands on the
casket and lowered his covered head. Jacob heard some of the words—he wanted to
hear everything—but he couldn’t make out the meaning.</p>

<p>The whispering went on—past
“Forgive me,” past “I forgive you.” What was he saying? Why did the Blochs find
it so hard to talk to one another while alive? Why couldn’t Jacob lie in a
casket long enough to hear his family’s unspeakable feelings, but then return
to the world of the living with what he’d learned? All the words were for those
who couldn’t respond to them.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>It was way too humid, and one
extemporaneous speech would have been way too many. The men sweated through
their underwear, through their white shirts and black suits, sweated all the
way into the folds of the handkerchiefs in their breast pockets. They were
losing their body weight in sweat, as if trying to become salt, like Lot’s
wife, or become nothing, like the man they were there to bury.</p>

<p>While most of the cousins felt
obliged to say a few words, none had felt obliged to prepare a few words, so
everyone was made to endure, in that humidity, more than an hour of rambling
generalities. Isaac was courageous. He was resilient. He loved. And the
embarrassing inversion of what the goyim say about their guy: he survived for
us.</p>

<p>Max told the story of the time his
great-grandfather took him aside and, apropos of no birthday, Hanukkah, glowing
report card, recital, or rite of passage, said, “What do you want? Anything.
Tell me. I want you to have the thing that you want.” Max told him he wanted a
drone. The next time Max visited, Isaac again took him aside, and presented him
with a board game called Reversi—either a knockoff of Othello, or what Othello
knocked off. Max pointed out to the mourners that if one were to try to think
of the word that sounded least like drone, it might be Reversi. Then he nodded,
or bowed, and returned to his mother’s side. No moral, consolation, or meaning.</p>

<p>Irv, who’d been working on his
speech since long before Isaac’s death, chose silence.</p>

<p>Tamir stood at a distance. It was
hard to tell if he was trying to repress emotion or generate some. More than
once, he used his phone. His casualness knew no limits, there was nothing he
couldn’t shrug off: death, natural catastrophe. It was something else about him
that angered Jacob and that Jacob almost certainly envied. Why couldn’t Tamir
be more like Jacob? That was the question. And why couldn’t Jacob be more like
Tamir? That was the other question. If they could meet halfway, they’d form a
reasonable Jew.</p>

<p>Finally, the rabbi stepped forward.
He cleared his throat, pushed his glasses up his nose, and took a small spiral-bound
pad from his pocket. He flipped through a few pages, then put it back, having
either committed the contents to memory or realized he’d accidentally brought
the wrong pad.</p>

<p>“What can we say about Isaac
Bloch?”</p>

<p>He left enough pause to generate
some rhetorical uncertainty. Was he actually asking a question? Admitting that
he didn’t know Isaac well enough to know what to say?</p>

<p>What can we say about Isaac Bloch?</p>

<p>Quickly, the wet cement of
annoyance that Jacob felt at the hearse dried into something to break fists
against. He hated this man. Hated his lazy righteousness, his bullshit
affectations, his obsessive beard-stroking and Central Casting hand gestures,
his too-tight collar and untied shoelaces and off-center yarmulke. This feeling
sometimes subsumed Jacob, this unnuanced, swift, and eternal loathing. It
happened with waiters, with David Letterman, with the rabbi who accused Sam.
More than once he had come home from lunch with an old friend, someone with
whom he had been through dozens of seasons of life, and casually said to Julia,
“I think we reached the end.” In the beginning, she didn’t know what he
meant—the end of what? why the end?—but after years of living beside such a
binary, unforgiving person, someone so agnostic about his own worth he was compelled
to a religious certainty about others’, she came to know him, if not understand
him.</p>

<p>“What can we say about someone
about whom there is too much to say?”</p>

<p>The rabbi put his hands in his
jacket pockets, closed his eyes, and nodded.</p>

<p>“Words don’t fail us, time does.
There isn’t time—not from now until time’s end—to recount the tragedy, and
heroism, and tragedy of Isaac Bloch’s life. We could stand here speaking about
him until our own funerals, and it wouldn’t be enough. I visited Isaac the
morning of his death.”</p>

<p>Wait, what? Was this possible?
Wasn’t he just the schmuck rabbi, here because half of the actually good
rabbi’s mouth had stopped functioning? If they’d stopped at Isaac’s on the way
back from the airport, would they have crossed this man’s path?</p>

<p>“He called, and he asked me to come
over. I heard no urgency in his voice. I heard no desperation. But I heard
need. So I went. It was my first time in his home. We’d only met once or twice
at shul, and always in passing. He had me sit at his kitchen table. He poured
me a glass of ginger ale, served me a plate of sliced pumpernickel, some
cantaloupe. Many of you have had that meal at that table.”</p>

<p>A gentle chuckle of recognition.</p>

<p>“He spoke slowly, and with effort.
He told me about Sam’s bar mitzvah, and Jacob’s show, and Max’s early long
division, and Benjy’s bike-riding, and Julia’s projects, and Irv’s
mishegas—that was his word.”</p>

<p>A chuckle. He was winning.</p>

<p>“And then he said, ‘Rabbi, I feel
no despair anymore. For seventy years I had only nightmares, but I have no
nightmares anymore. I feel only gratitude for my life, for every moment I
lived. Not only the good moments. I feel gratitude for every moment of my life.
I have seen so many miracles.’”</p>

<p>This was either the most audacious
heaping and steaming mountain of Jewshit ever shoveled by a rabbi or anyone, or
a revelatory glimpse into Isaac Bloch’s consciousness. Only the rabbi knew for
sure—what was accurately recounted, what was embellished, what was fabricated
out of whole tallis. Had anyone ever heard Isaac use the word despair? Or
gratitude? He’d have said, “It was horrible, but it could have been worse.” But
would he have said that? Thankful for what? And what were all these miracles
he’d witnessed?</p>

<p>“Then he asked me if I spoke
Yiddish. I told him no. He said, ‘What kind of rabbi doesn’t speak Yiddish?’”</p>

<p>A proper laugh.</p>

<p>“I told him my grandparents spoke
Yiddish to my parents, but my parents would never let me hear it. They wanted
me to learn English. To forget Yiddish. He told me he’d done the same, that he
was the last Yiddish-speaker in his family, that the language would be in the
casket, too. And then he put his hand on my hand and said, ‘Let me teach you a
Yiddish expression.’ He looked me in the eye and said, ‘Kein briere iz oich a
breire.’ I asked him what it meant. He took back his hand and said, ‘Look it
up.’”</p>

<p>Another laugh.</p>

<p>“I did look it up. On my phone, in
his bathroom.”</p>

<p>Another laugh.</p>

<p>“Kein briere iz oich a breire. It
means ‘Not to have a choice is also a choice.’”</p>

<p>No, those words couldn’t have been
his. They were too faux-enlightened, too content with circumstance. Isaac Bloch
was many things, and resigned was not one of them.</p>

<p>If having no choice were a choice,
Isaac would have run out of choices once a day after 1938. But the family
needed him, especially before the family existed. They needed him to turn his back
on his grandparents, his parents, and five of his brothers. They needed him to
hide in that hole with Benny, to walk with rigid legs toward Russia, eat other
people’s garbage at night, hide, steal, forage. They needed him to forge
documents to board the boat, and tell the right lies to the U.S. immigration
officer, and work eighteen-hour days to keep the grocery profitable.</p>

<p>“Then,” the young rabbi said, “he
asked me to pick up toilet paper for him at the Safeway, because they were
having a sale.”</p>

<p>Everyone chuckled.</p>

<p>“I told him he didn’t need to buy
toilet paper anymore. It would be taken care of by the Jewish Home. He gave me
a knowing smile and said, ‘But that price…’”</p>

<p>A louder, freer laugh.</p>

<p>“‘That’s it?’ I asked. ‘That’s it,’
he said. ‘Was there something you wanted to hear? Something you wanted to say?’
He said, ‘There are two things that everybody needs. The first is to feel that
he is adding to the world. Do you agree?’ I told him I did. ‘The second,’ he
said, ‘is toilet paper.’”</p>

<p>The loudest laugh yet.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking about a Hasidic
teaching that I learned as a rabbinical student. There are three ascending
levels of mourning: with tears, with silence, and with song. How do we mourn
Isaac Bloch? With tears, with silence, or with song? How do we mourn the end of
his life? The end of the Jewish epoch that he participated in and exemplified?
The end of Jews who speak in that music of broken instruments; who arrange
their grammar counterclockwise and miss the point of every cliché; who say mine
instead of my, the German people instead of Nazis, and who implore their
perfectly healthy relatives to be healthy instead of feeling silent gratitude
for health? The end of hundred-and-fifty-decibel kisses, of that drunken
European script. Do we shed tears for their disappearance? Silently grieve? Or
sing their praises?</p>

<p>“Isaac Bloch was not the last of
his kind, but once gone, his kind will be gone forever. We know them—we have
lived among them, they have shaped us as Jews and Americans, as sons and
daughters, grandsons and granddaughters—but our time of knowing them is nearly
complete. And then they will be gone forever. And we will only remember them.
Until we don’t.</p>

<p>“We know them. We know them with
tears for their suffering, with silence for all that cannot be said, and with
song for their unprecedented resilience. There will be no more old Jews who
interpret a spot of good news as the guarantee of imminent apocalypse, who
treat buffets like grocery stores before blizzards, who touch a finger to the
bottom lip before turning a page of their people’s Maxwell House epic.”</p>

<p>Jacob’s hatred was softening—not
evaporating, not even melting, but losing its shape.</p>

<p>The rabbi paused, brought his hands
together, and sighed. “As we stand at Isaac Bloch’s grave, there is a war going
on. There are two wars. One is on the brink of breaking out. The other has been
happening for seventy years. The imminent war will determine the survival of
Israel. The old war will determine the survival of the Jewish soul.</p>

<p>“Survival has been the central
theme and imperative of Jewish existence since the beginning, and not because
we chose it to be that way. We have always had enemies, always been hunted.
It’s not true that everyone hates Jews, but in every country we’ve ever lived,
in every decade of every century, we have encountered hatred.</p>

<p>“So we’ve slept with one eye open,
kept packed suitcases in the closet and one-way train tickets in the breast
pockets of our shirts, against our hearts. We’ve made efforts not to offend or
be too noisy. To achieve, yes, but not to draw undue attention to ourselves in
the process. We’ve organized our lives around the will to perpetuate our
lives—with our stories, habits, values, dreams, and anxieties. Who could blame
us? We are a traumatized people. And nothing else has trauma’s power to deform
the mind and heart.</p>

<p>“If you were to ask one hundred
Jews what was the Jewish book of the century, you would get one answer: The
Diary of Anne Frank. If you were to ask what was the Jewish work of art of the
century, you would get the same answer. This despite it having been created
neither as a book nor as a work of art, and not in the century in which the
question was asked. But its appeal—symbolically, and on its own terms—is
overpowering.”</p>

<p>Jacob looked around to see if
anyone else was as surprised by the direction this was taking. No one seemed
fazed. Even Irv, whose head only ever rotated on the axis of disagreement, was
nodding.</p>

<p>“But is it good for us? Has it been
good to align ourselves with poignancy over rigor, with hiding over seeking,
victimization over will? No one could blame Anne Frank for dying, but we could
blame ourselves for telling her story as our own. Our stories are so
fundamental to us that it’s easy to forget that we choose them. We choose to
rip certain pages from our history books, and coil others into our mezuzot. We
choose to make life the ultimate Jewish value, rather than differentiate the
values of kinds of life, or, more radically, admit that there are things even
more important than being alive.</p>

<p>“So much of Judaism today—regarding
Larry David as anything beyond very funny, the existence and persistence of the
Jewish American Princess, the embrace of klutziness, the fear of wrath, the
shifting emphasis from argument to confession—is the direct consequence of our
choice to have Anne Frank’s diary replace the Bible as our bible. Because the
Jewish Bible, whose purpose is to delineate and transmit Jewish values, makes
it abundantly clear that life itself is not the loftiest ambition.
Righteousness is.</p>

<p>“Abraham argues with God to spare
Sodom because of the righteousness of its citizens. Not because life is
inherently deserving of saving, but because righteousness should be spared.</p>

<p>“God destroys the earth with a
flood, sparing only Noah, who was ‘righteous in his own time.’</p>

<p>“Then there is the concept of the
Lamed Vovniks—the thirty-six righteous men of every generation, because of
whose merit the entire world is spared destruction. Humankind is saved not
because it is worth saving, but because the righteousness of a few justifies
the existence of the rest.</p>

<p>“A trope from my Jewish upbringing,
and perhaps from yours, was this line from the Talmud: ‘And whoever saves a
life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.’ This is a beautiful
idea, and one worth living by. But we shouldn’t ascribe more meaning to it than
it contains.</p>

<p>“How much greater the Jewish people
might be today if instead of not dying, our ambition was living righteously. If
instead of ‘It was done to me,’ our mantra was ‘I did it.’”</p>

<p>He paused. He held a long blink and
bit at his lower lip.</p>

<p>“There are things that are hard to
say today.”</p>

<p>He almost smiled, as Irv had almost
smiled when touching Jacob’s face.</p>

<p>“Judaism has a special relationship
with words. Giving a word to a thing is to give it life. ‘Let there be light,’
God said, and there was light. No magic. No raised hands and thunder. The
articulation made it possible. It is perhaps the most powerful of all Jewish
ideas: expression is generative.</p>

<p>“It’s the same with marriage. You
say, ‘I do,’ and you do. What is it, really, to be married?”</p>

<p>Jacob felt a burning across his
scalp. Julia needed to move her fingers.</p>

<p>“To be married is to say you are
married. To say it not only in front of your spouse, but in front of your
community, and, if you are a believer, in front of God.</p>

<p>“And so it is with prayer, with
true prayer, which is never a request, and never praise, but the expression of
something of extreme significance that would otherwise have no way to be
expressed. As Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote, ‘Prayer may not save us. But prayer
may make us worthy of being saved.’ We are made worthy, made righteous, by
expression.”</p>

<p>He bit again at his lower lip and
shook his head.</p>

<p>“There are things that are hard to
say today.</p>

<p>“It is often the case that everyone
says what no one knows. Today, no one says what everyone knows.</p>

<p>“As I think about the wars in front
of us—the war to save our lives, and the war to save our souls—I think about
our greatest leader, Moses. You might remember that his mother, Jochebed, hides
him in a reed basket, which she releases into the current of the Nile, as a
last hope of sparing his life. The basket is discovered by Pharaoh’s daughter.
‘Look!’ she says. ‘A crying Hebrew baby.’ But how did she know that he was a
Hebrew?”</p>

<p>The rabbi paused, and held the
agitated silence in place, as if forcefully saving the life of a bird that only
wanted to fly away.</p>

<p>Max spoke up: “Probably because
Hebrews were trying to keep their kids from getting killed, and only someone in
that situation would ever put her baby in a basket and send it down the river.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” the rabbi said, showing
no condescending pleasure in Max’s confidence, only admiration for his thought.
“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>And again he forced silence.</p>

<p>Sam spoke up: “So, I say this fully
seriously: maybe she saw that he was circumcised? Right? She says, ‘Look.’”</p>

<p>“That could be,” the rabbi said,
nodding.</p>

<p>And he dug a silence.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything,” Benjy
said, “but maybe he was crying in Jewish?”</p>

<p>“How would one cry in Jewish?” the
rabbi asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything,” Benjy said
again.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows anything,” the rabbi
said. “So let’s try to learn together. How would one cry in Jewish?”</p>

<p>“I guess babies don’t really
speak.”</p>

<p>“Do tears?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“It’s strange,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t she have heard him
crying? That’s how it works. You hear them crying, and you go to them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“She said, ‘Look! A crying Hebrew
baby.’ Look. She saw that he was crying, but didn’t hear.”</p>

<p>“So tell me what that implies,” he
said—no patronizing, no self-righteousness.</p>

<p>“She knew he was a Hebrew because
only Jews cry silently.”</p>

<p>For an instant, for a stitch, Jacob
was overwhelmed by the terror that he had managed to lose the most intelligent
person on earth.</p>

<p>“Was she right?” the rabbi asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Julia said. “He was a
Hebrew.”</p>

<p>“But was she right that Jews cry
silently?”</p>

<p>“Not in my experience,” Julia said,
with a chuckle that drew a depressurizing chuckle from the others.</p>

<p>Without moving, the rabbi stepped
into the grave of silence. He looked at Julia, almost unbearably directly, as
if they were the only two living people left, as if the only thing that
distinguished those buried from those standing was ninety degrees.</p>

<p>He looked into her and said, “But
in your experience, do Jews cry silently?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“And now I’d like to ask you a
question, Benjy.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“Let’s say we have two choices, as
Jews: to cry silently, as your mother has said, or to cry in Jewish, as you
said. What would it sound like to cry in Jewish?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows, so you can’t be
wrong.”</p>

<p>“I don’t even have a guess.”</p>

<p>“Maybe like laughing?” Max
suggested.</p>

<p>“Like laughing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. That’s what we do.”</p>

<p>For an instant, for a stitch, Jacob
was overwhelmed by the terror that he had managed to ruin the three most beautiful
human beings on earth.</p>

<p>He remembered when Sam was young,
how every time he got a scrape, cut, or burn, after every blood test, every
fall from every tree branch that was forever after deemed “too high,” Jacob
would urgently pick him up, as if the ground were suddenly on fire, and say,
“You’re fine. It’s OK. It’s nothing. You’re fine.” And Sam would always believe
him. And Jacob would be thrilled by how well it worked, and ashamed by how well
it worked. Sometimes, if a greater lie was needed, if there was visible blood,
Jacob would even say, “It’s funny.” And his son would believe him, because sons
have no choice. But sons do feel pain. And the absence of the expression of
pain is not the absence of pain. It is a different pain. When Sam’s hand was
crushed, he said, “It’s funny. It’s funny, right?” That was his inheritance.</p>

<p>The columns of Jacob’s legs
couldn’t bear the weight of his heavy heart. He felt himself buckling, in
weakness or genuflection.</p>

<p>He put his arm on Julia’s shoulder.
She didn’t turn to him, she showed no acknowledgment of his touch, but she kept
him standing.</p>

<p>“So,” the rabbi said, reassuming
his authority, “what can we say about Isaac Bloch, and how should we mourn him?
There are only two kinds of Jews of his generation: those who perished and
those who survived. We swore our allegiance to the victims, were good on our
promise never to forget them. But we turned our backs on those who endured, and
forgot them. All our love was for the dead.</p>

<p>“But now the two kinds of Jews have
equal mortal standing. Isaac might not be with his brothers in an afterlife,
but he is with his brothers in death. So what can we now say about him, and how
should we mourn him? It was not because they lacked strength that his brothers
died, but it was because of his strength that Isaac lived and died. Kein briere
iz oich a breire. Not to have a choice is also a choice. How will we tell the
story of he who never had no choice? At stake is our notion of righteousness,
of a life worth saving.</p>

<p>“What was Moses crying about? Was
he crying for himself? Out of hunger or fear? Was he crying for his people?
Their bondage, their suffering? Or were they tears of gratitude? Perhaps
Pharaoh’s daughter didn’t hear him crying because he wasn’t crying until she
opened the wicker basket.</p>

<p>“How should we mourn Isaac Bloch?
With tears—what kind of tears? With silence—what silence? Or with what kind of
song? Our answer will not save him, but it might save us.”</p>

<p>With all three, of course. Jacob
could see the rabbi’s moves from five thousand years away. With all three, because
of the tragedy, because of our reverence, because of our gratitude. Because of
everything that was necessary to bring us to this moment, because of the lies
that lie ahead, because of the moments of joy so extreme they have no relation
to happiness. With tears, with silence, with song, because he survived so we
could sin, because our religion is as gorgeous, and opaque, and brittle, as the
stained glass of Kol Nidre, because Ecclesiastes was wrong: there isn’t time
for every purpose.</p>

<p>What do you want? Anything. Tell
me. I want you to have the thing that you want.</p>

<p>Jacob cried.</p>

<p>He wailed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE NAMES WERE MAGNIFICENT</h2>

<p>Jacob carried the casket with his
cousins. It was so much lighter than he’d imagined it would be. How could
someone with such a heavy life weigh so little? And the job was surprisingly
awkward: they nearly fell over a few times, and Irv was only a half teeter from
tumbling into the grave with his father.</p>

<p>“This is the worst cemetery ever,”
Max said to no one in particular, but loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>Finally, they were able to position
the simple pine coffin on the broad strips of fabric that eased it into the
grave.</p>

<p>And there it was: the fact of it.
Irv bore the responsibility—the privilege of the mitzvah—of shoveling the first
dirt onto his father’s coffin. He took a heaping mound, turned his body to the
hole, and tipped the shovel, letting it fall. It was louder than it should have
been, and more violent, as if every particle of soil hit the wood at once, and
as if it had been dropped from a far greater height. Jacob winced. Julia and
the boys winced. Everyone winced. Some were thinking of the body in the coffin.
Some were thinking of Irv.</p>

<p>HOW TO PLAY EARLY MEMORIES</p>

<p>My earliest memories are hidden
around my grandfather’s final house like afikomens: dish-soap bubble baths;
knee-football games in the basement with the grandchildren of survivors—they
always ended in injury; the seemingly moving eyes of Golda Meir’s portrait;
instant-coffee crystals; pearls of grease on the surface of every liquid; games
of Uno at his kitchen table, just us two humans, just yesterday’s bagel, last
week’s Jewish Week, and juice from concentrate from whenever in history was the
last significant sale. I always beat him. Sometimes we’d play one hundred games
a night, sometimes both nights of the weekend, sometimes three weekends a
month. He always lost.</p>

<p>What I think of as my earliest
memory couldn’t possibly be my earliest memory—it’s too far into my life. I am
confusing foundational with earliest, in the same way that, as Julia used to
point out, the first floor of a house is usually the second, and sometimes the
third.</p>

<p>This is my earliest memory: I was
raking the leaves in front of the house when I saw something against the side
door. Ants were beginning to envelop a dead squirrel. For how long had it been
there? Had it eaten poison? What poison? Had a neighborhood dog killed it and
then, full of a dog’s remorse, delivered his shame? Or perhaps his pride? Or
had the squirrel died trying to get in?</p>

<p>I ran inside and told my mother.
Her glasses were steamed over; she was stirring a pot she couldn’t see. Without
looking up she said, “Go tell Dad to take care of it.”</p>

<p>Through the open door—on the safe
side of the threshold—I watched my father cover his hand with the clear plastic
bag that the morning’s Post had come in, pick up the squirrel, and then pull
his hand out, turning the bag inside out with the squirrel in it. While my
father washed his hands in the bathroom sink, I stood at his side and asked him
question after question. I was always being taught lessons, and so came to
assume that everything conveyed some necessary piece of information, some
moral.</p>

<p>Was it cold? When do you think it
died? How do you think it died? Didn’t it bother you?</p>

<p>“Bother me?” my father asked.</p>

<p>“Gross you out.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“But you just went out there and
did it like it was nothing.”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>I followed his wedding ring through
the soap.</p>

<p>“Did you think it was disgusting?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“It was so gross.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have done it.”</p>

<p>He laughed a father’s laugh and
said, “One day you’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“What if I can’t?”</p>

<p>“When you’re a dad, there’s no one
above you. If I don’t do something that has to be done, who is going to do it?”</p>

<p>“I still couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“The more you won’t want to do it,
the more of a dad you’ll be.”</p>

<p>The closet was filled with hundreds
of plastic bags. He had chosen a clear one to teach me a lesson.</p>

<p>I obsessed over that squirrel for a
few days, and then didn’t think about it again for a quarter century, until
Julia was pregnant with Sam, at which point I started having a recurrent dream
of dead squirrels lining the streets of our neighborhood. There were thousands
of them: pushed against curbs, filling public garbage cans, prone in final
poses while automatic sprinkler systems soaked through their fur. In the dream
I was always returning home from somewhere, always walking up our street, it
was always the end of the day. The window shades of the house were illuminated
like TV screens. We didn’t have a working fireplace, but smoke poured from the
chimney. I had to walk on tiptoes to avoid stepping on squirrels, and sometimes
it couldn’t be avoided. I apologized—to whom? There were squirrels on the
windowsills, and on stoops, and pouring from the gutters. I could see their silhouettes
on the undersides of awnings. They hung halfway out of mail slots, in apparent
attempts to find food or water, or simply to die inside—like that squirrel that
had wanted to die inside my childhood home. I knew I was going to have to take
care of all of them.</p>

<p>Jacob wanted to go to his father’s
side, as he had as a child, and ask him how he managed to shovel dirt into his
father’s grave.</p>

<p>Did you think it was disgusting?</p>

<p>I did, his father would have said.</p>

<p>I couldn’t have done it.</p>

<p>His father would have laughed a
father’s laugh and said, One day you’ll do it.</p>

<p>What if I can’t?</p>

<p>Children bury their dead parents,
because the dead need to be buried. Parents do not need to bring their children
into the world, but children need to bring their parents out of it.</p>

<p>Irv handed the shovel to Jacob.
Their eyes met. The father whispered into the son’s ear: “Here we are and will
be.”</p>

<p>When Jacob imagined his children
surviving him, he felt no version of immortality, as it’s sometimes
unimaginatively put, usually by people who are trying to encourage others to
have children. He felt no contentment or peace or satisfaction of any kind. He
felt only the overwhelming sadness of missing out. Death felt less fair with
children, because there was more to miss. Whom would Benjy marry? (Despite
himself, Jacob couldn’t shake his Jewish certainty that of course he would want
to marry, and would marry.) To what ethical and lucrative profession would Sam
be drawn? What odd hobbies would Max indulge? Where would they travel? What
would their children look like? (Of course they would want to have children,
and have children.) How would they cope and celebrate? How would each die? (At
least he would miss their deaths. Maybe that was the compensation for having to
die himself.)</p>

<p>Before returning to the car, Jacob
went for a walk. He read the gravestones like pages in an enormous book. The
names were magnificent—because they were Jewish haiku, because they traveled in
time machines while those they identified were left behind, because they were
as embarrassing as pennies collected in paper rolls, because they were as
beautiful as boats in bottles brought over on boats, because they were
mnemonics: Miriam Apfel, Shaindel Potash, Beryl Dressler … He wanted to
remember them, to use them later. He wanted to remember all of it, to use it
all: the rabbi’s shoelaces, the untied melodies of grief, the hardened
footprints of a visitor in the rain.</p>

<p>Sidney Landesman, Ethel Keiser,
Lebel Alterman, Deborah Fischbach, Lazer Berenbaum …</p>

<p>He would remember the names. He
wouldn’t lose them. He would use them. He would make something of the no longer
anything.</p>

<p>Seymour Kaiser, Shoshanna Ostrov,
Elsa Glaser, Sura Needleman, Hymie Rattner, Simcha Tisch, Dinah Perlman, Ruchel
Neustadt, Izzie Reinhardt, Ruben Fischman, Hindel Schulz …</p>

<p>Like listening to a Jewish river.
But you can step in it twice. You can—Jacob could; he believed he could—take
all that was lost and re-find it, reanimate it, breathe new life into the
collapsed lungs of those names, those accents, those idioms and mannerisms and
ways of being. The young rabbi was right: no one would ever have such names
again. But he was wrong.</p>

<p>Mayer Vogel, Frida Walzer, Yussel
Offenbacher, Rachel Blumenstein, Velvel Kronberg, Leah Beckerman, Mendel Fogelman,
Sarah Bronstein, Schmuel Gersh, Wolf Seligman, Abner Edelson, Judith Weisz,
Bernard Rosenbluth, Eliezer Umansky, Ruth Abramowicz, Irving Perlman, Leonard
Goldberger, Nathan Moskowitz, Pincus Ziskind, Solomon Altman …</p>

<p>Jacob had once read that there are
more people alive now than have died in all of human history. But it didn’t
feel that way. It felt as if everyone were dead. And for all the
individuality—for the extreme idiosyncrasy of the names of those extremely
idiosyncratic Jews—there was only one fate.</p>

<p>And then he found himself where two
walls met, at the corner of the vast cemetery, at the corner of the vast
everything.</p>

<p>He turned to face the immensity,
and only then did it occur to him, or only then was he forced to acknowledge
what he’d forced himself not to: He was standing among suicides. He was in the
ghetto for those unfit to be buried with the rest. This corner was where the
shame was cordoned off. This was where the unspeakable shame was put beneath
the ground. Milk on one set of plates, meat on the other: never the two should
meet.</p>

<p>Miriam Apfel, Shaindel Potash,
Beryl Dressler …</p>

<p>He had some vague awareness of the
prohibition against taking one’s own life, and the price—beyond death—for
having done so. The punishment wasn’t for the criminal, but the victims: those
left behind and now forced to bury their dead in the other-earth. He remembered
it like he remembered the prohibition against tattoos—something about
desecrating the body—which would also land you in the other-earth. And—less spiritual,
but every bit as religious—the prohibition against drinking Pepsi, because
Pepsi chose to market to Arab countries and not Israel. And the prohibition
against touching a shiksa in any of the ways one was dying to, because it was a
shanda. And the prohibition against resisting when elders touched any part of
your body they wanted, in any way they wanted, because they were dying,
perpetually dying, and it was a mitzvah.</p>

<p>Standing in that unwalled ghetto,
he thought about eruvs—a wonderfully Jewish loophole that Julia had shared,
before he even knew the prohibition it was circumventing. She’d learned about
them not in the context of a Jewish education, but in architecture school: an
example of a “magical structure.”</p>

<p>Jews can’t “carry” on Shabbat: no
keys, no money, no tissues or medicine, no strollers or canes, not even
children who can’t yet walk. The prohibition against carrying is technically
against carrying from private to public domains. But what if large areas were
made to be private? What if an entire neighborhood were a private domain? A
city? An eruv is a string or wire that encloses an area, making it private, and
thus permitting carrying. Jerusalem is enclosed by an eruv. Virtually all of
Manhattan is enclosed by an eruv. There is an eruv in nearly every Jewish
community in the world.</p>

<p>“In D.C.?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen it.”</p>

<p>“You’ve never looked for it.”</p>

<p>She took him to the intersection of
Reno and Davenport, where the eruv turned a corner and was most easy to see.
There it was, like dental floss. They followed it down Davenport to Linnean,
and Brandywine, and Broad Branch. They walked beneath the string as it ran from
street sign to lamppost to power pole to telephone pole.</p>

<p>As he stood among the suicides, his
pockets were full: a paper clip that Sam had somehow bent into an airplane, a
crumpled twenty, Max’s yarmulke from the funeral (apparently acquired at the
wedding of two people Jacob had never heard of), the dry-cleaning ticket for
the pants he was wearing, a pebble Benjy had taken from a grave and asked Jacob
to hold, more keys than there were locks in his life. The older he got, the
more he carried, the stronger it should have made him.</p>

<p>Isaac was buried in a pocketless
shroud, six hundred yards from his wife of two hundred thousand hours.</p>

<p>Seymour Kaiser: loving brother,
loving son; head in the oven. Shoshanna Ostrov: loving wife; wrists slit in the
bath. Elsa Glaser: loving mother and grandmother; hanging from the ceiling fan.
Sura Needleman: loving wife, mother, and sister; walked into a river, pockets
full of stones. Hymie Rattner: loving son; wrists slit over the bathroom sink.
Simcha Tisch: loving father, loving brother; steak knife in the gut. Dinah
Perlman: loving grandmother, mother, and sister; leaped from the top of the
stairs. Ruchel Neustadt: loving wife and mother; letter opener in the neck.
Izzie Reinhardt: loving father, husband, and brother; jumped from Memorial
Bridge. Ruben Fischman: loving husband; drove his car into a tree at one
hundred miles per hour. Hindel Schulz: loving mother; serrated bread knife
across the wrist. Isaac Bloch: loving brother, husband, father, grandfather,
and great-grandfather; hanging by a belt in his kitchen.</p>

<p>Jacob wanted to pull the thread
from his black suit, tie it around the tree in the corner, and walk the
perimeter of the suicide ghetto, enclosing it as he unraveled. And then, when
the public had been made private, he would carry away the shame. But to where?</p>

<p>Every landmass is surrounded by
water. Was every coast an eruv?</p>

<p>Was the equator an eruv around the
earth?</p>

<p>Did Pluto’s orbit enclose the solar
system?</p>

<p>And the wedding ring still on his
finger?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>REINCARNATION</h2>

<p>&gt; So what’s new?</p>

<p>&gt; You’re the one in the middle
of a crisis.</p>

<p>&gt; That isn’t new.</p>

<p>&gt; Everything’s the same here,
except my great-grandfather is dead.</p>

<p>&gt; Your family is OK?</p>

<p>&gt; Yeah. I think my dad is pretty
upset, but it’s hard to tell, because he always seems a bit upset.</p>

<p>&gt; Right.</p>

<p>&gt; And it’s not like it was his
dad, anyway. Just his grandfather. Which is still sad, but less sad. Far less
sad.</p>

<p>&gt; Right.</p>

<p>&gt; I really do like it when
people repeat bits of language. Why is that?</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t know.</p>

<p>&gt; Your dad and brother seem to
be having a good time. They’re worried about you, obviously. They talk about
you constantly. But if they can’t be there, it’s good that they’re here.</p>

<p>&gt; Have they found anything?</p>

<p>&gt; What do you mean?</p>

<p>&gt; A house.</p>

<p>&gt; For what?</p>

<p>&gt; To buy.</p>

<p>&gt; Why would they buy a house
here?</p>

<p>&gt; My father hasn’t mentioned it?</p>

<p>&gt; Mentioned what?</p>

<p>&gt; Maybe to your dad?</p>

<p>&gt; You guys are moving?</p>

<p>&gt; He’s been talking about it for
a few years, but when it was time for me to join the army, he started looking.
Just on websites, and maybe with the help of some brokers over there. I thought
it was just talk, but when I was deployed to the West Bank, he started
searching more seriously. I think he found a few places that seemed promising,
and that’s why he’s over there now. To see them in person.</p>

<p>&gt; I thought it was for my bar
mitzvah.</p>

<p>&gt; That’s why he’s staying more
than a few days.</p>

<p>&gt; I had no idea.</p>

<p>&gt; He might be embarrassed.</p>

<p>&gt; I didn’t know he was capable
of feeling embarrassment.</p>

<p>&gt; Feeling it, yes. Showing it,
no.</p>

<p>&gt; Your mom wants to move?</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t know.</p>

<p>&gt; Do you want to move?</p>

<p>&gt; I doubt I’ll live with my
parents again. After the army, school. After school, life. I hope.</p>

<p>&gt; But what do you think about
it?</p>

<p>&gt; I try not to.</p>

<p>&gt; Do you find it embarrassing?</p>

<p>&gt; No. That’s not the right word.</p>

<p>&gt; Do you think your dad cheats
on your mom?</p>

<p>&gt; That’s a strange question.</p>

<p>&gt; Is it?</p>

<p>&gt; Yes.</p>

<p>&gt; Yes, it’s a strange question?
Or yes, you think your dad cheats on your mom?</p>

<p>&gt; Both.</p>

<p>&gt; Jesus. Really?</p>

<p>&gt; Someone who asks that question
shouldn’t be so surprised by the answer.</p>

<p>&gt; What makes you think he cheats
on her?</p>

<p>&gt; What makes you ask the
question?</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t know.</p>

<p>&gt; So ask yourself.</p>

<p>&gt; What makes me ask the
question?</p>

<p>He was not asking for no reason. He
was asking because he’d found his dad’s second phone a day before his mom had.
Found is probably not the right word, as coming upon it was the result of
snooping through his dad’s favorite hiding places—beneath a pile of socks in
the dresser, in a box in the back of the “gift closet,” atop the grandfather
clock his grandfather had given them on the occasion of Benjy’s birth. The loot
was never anything more salacious than a porno—“Why,” he wanted to ask but
could never ask, “why would anyone with a desktop, laptop, tablet, or
smartphone pay for pornography?”</p>

<p>He had found a stack of fifties,
presumably for some indulgence his dad didn’t want his mom to know
about—something perfectly innocent like a power tool he was afraid his mom
would point out he would never actually use. He had found a tiny bag of pot,
which never, in the year and a half that he would check on it, diminished in
size. He’d found a stash of Halloween candy—just sad. He’d found a stack of
papers with a cover sheet labeled “Bible for Ever-Dying People”—</p>

<p>HOW TO PLAY DESIRE</p>

<p>Don’t. You have everything you
could ever need or want. You are healthy (for now) and it’s great. Do you have
any idea how much suffering and toil was necessary to make this moment
possible? Possible for you? Reflect on how great it is, how lucky and fully
satisfied you are.</p>

<p>—too boring to investigate further.</p>

<p>But then, while nosing around in
the drawer of his dad’s bedside table, Sam found a phone. His dad’s phone was
an iPhone. Everyone knew that, because everyone suffered his endless complaints
about how amazing it was, and how dependent he was on it. (“This is literally
ruining my life,” he would say as he performed some utterly unnecessary
function, like checking the weather three days out. “Chance of rain.
Interesting.”) This was a generic smartphone, the kind they give you for free
with a criminally overpriced plan. Maybe a relic that his dad was too nostalgic
to throw out? Maybe it was filled with photos of Sam and his brothers, and his
dad wasn’t smart enough to transfer them to his iPhone (despite feeling too
smart to ask for help at a phone store, or even from his technologically
proficient son), so he saved it, and over time the drawer would probably fill
with phones filled with photos.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been easier than
figuring out how to unlock it—his dad cycled through the same three lamely
predictable variations of the family password for all his security needs.</p>

<p>Generic wallpaper: a sunset.</p>

<p>No games. No apps cooler than a
calculator. Why even have a smartphone?</p>

<p>It was a mom phone. A private phone
between them. It was hard to understand the need for it, but maybe the lack of
need was the point. It was actually kind of sweet. Kind of lame, but kind of
romantic, which was kind of gross. Unless it had some sort of straightforward
justification, as it now-that-he-thought-about-it probably did, like being the
phone they took on trips, with prepaid international minutes.</p>

<p>As he scrolled through the
messages, it became clear that those explanations were wrong, extremely wrong,
and that either his parents weren’t who he thought they were, not even close,
or there was more than one Julia in the world, because the Julia that was his
mom would never—no, never—move her thumbs in such a way as to form the words
take the wetness from my pussy and use it to get my asshole ready for you.</p>

<p>He took the phone to the bathroom,
locked the door, and scrolled.</p>

<p>i want two of your fingers in each
of my holes</p>

<p>What, like Spock? What the fuck was
going on?</p>

<p>on your stomach, legs spread to the
corners, your hands behind you, opening your ass as wide as it will go, your
pussy dripping onto the sheets …</p>

<p>What the fuck was going on?</p>

<p>But before Sam could ask the
question a third time, the front door opened, the phone dropped behind the
toilet, his mom said, “I’m home,” and he tried to beat the footsteps on the
stairs to his room.</p>

<p>He’d never met Dr. Silvers, but he
knew what Dr. Silvers would have said: he left the phone on purpose. Like
everyone in the family who wasn’t his dad, Sam loathed Dr. Silvers and was
jealous of his dad for having such a confidant, and was jealous of Dr. Silvers
for having his dad. What good, of any kind, could come, for anyone, from the
discovery of the phone?</p>

<p>&gt; Is your dad cheating on your
mom, or something?</p>

<p>Suddenly, back in real unreal life,
Eyesick stumbled away a few yards. He limped a bit, walked with a stutter.
After making circles around nothing—like a planet around no sun, or a bride
around no groom—he picked up the fossil of a bird from one of the earliest
generations of Other Life, maybe three years before: the Twitter logo. Eyesick
looked at the rock dumbly, then put it down, then picked it up again, then
motioned as if to throw it, then tapped it against his head, as if testing his
own ripeness.</p>

<p>&gt; Are you seeing this glitch?</p>

<p>&gt; No glitch. I started the
transfer.</p>

<p>&gt; Of what?</p>

<p>&gt; Resilience fruit.</p>

<p>&gt; I told you not to.</p>

<p>&gt; You didn’t. And if you had, I
would have ignored you.</p>

<p>A flood of digital images, each
blooming on the screen and then receding as soon as it could be processed: some
were stored moments from Samanta’s other life, conversations she’d had,
experiences; others were more impressionistic. He saw screens that he’d looked
at, mixed with screens Noam must have looked at: a contrail in a blue sky;
crocheted rainbows on Etsy; the shovel of a bulldozer making contact with an
old woman; cunnilingus, from behind, in a changing room; a thrashing lab
monkey; conjoined twins (one laughing, one crying); satellite photos of the
Sinai; unconscious football players; nail polish color wheels; Evander
Holyfield’s ear; a dog being euthanized.</p>

<p>&gt; How many are you transferring?</p>

<p>&gt; All of them.</p>

<p>&gt; What?</p>

<p>&gt; 1,738,341.</p>

<p>&gt; HOLY FUCKING SHIT! You have
that many banked?</p>

<p>&gt; I’m giving you a total
transfusion.</p>

<p>&gt; What?</p>

<p>&gt; Listen, I have to get myself
ready to go.</p>

<p>&gt; Where?</p>

<p>&gt; Jerusalem. My unit was
mobilized. But don’t tell my father, OK?</p>

<p>&gt; Why not?</p>

<p>&gt; He’ll worry.</p>

<p>&gt; But he should worry.</p>

<p>&gt; But his worrying won’t help
him, and it won’t help me.</p>

<p>&gt; I don’t even need all of this.
I only had 45,000 when my dad killed me.</p>

<p>&gt; Make yourself great.</p>

<p>&gt; My avatar.</p>

<p>&gt; Your great-grandfather.</p>

<p>&gt; This is too much.</p>

<p>&gt; I should let it rot? Make
resilience cider?</p>

<p>&gt; You should use it.</p>

<p>&gt; But I won’t. And you will.</p>

<p>The images came more quickly, so
quick they could enter only subliminally; they overlapped, blended, and from
the corner a light, bleeding from a few pixels to stain the screen, and
spreading, a light like the darkness a broken pipe leaves on the ceiling, a
light flooding the perpetually refreshing images, and then more light than
image, and then an almost entirely white screen, but brighter than white, vague
images as if seen through an avalanche.</p>

<p>In perhaps the purest moment of
empathy of Sam’s life, he tried to imagine what Noam was seeing on his screen
at that moment. Was a darkness like light spreading? Was he receiving warnings
about low levels of vitality? Sam imagined Noam clicking IGNORE to those
warnings, over and over, and ignoring the annoying alerts, and clicking CONFIRM
when finally prompted to confirm his ultimate choice.</p>

<p>The lion walked to the old man,
knelt beside him, laid his immense and proud paws on Eyesick’s stooped
shoulders, licked at whatever one calls a white five o’clock shadow (a five
o’clock brightness?), licked him over and over, as if to will Eyesick back to
life, when in fact he was willing himself back to what comes before life.</p>

<p>&gt; Look at you, Bar Mitzvah.</p>

<p>He rested his massive head on
Eyesick’s sunken chest. Eyesick hid his fingers in the lion’s streaming mane.</p>

<p>In the middle of his
great-grandfather’s funeral reception, Sam started to cry. He didn’t cry often.
He hadn’t cried since Argus returned from his second hip replacement, two years
before, his back half shaved to reveal Frankenstein stitches, his eyes lowered
in his lowered head.</p>

<p>“It’s just what getting better
looks like,” Jacob had said. “In a month, he’ll be his old self.”</p>

<p>“A month?”</p>

<p>“It’ll pass quickly.”</p>

<p>“Not for Argus, it won’t.”</p>

<p>“We’ll spoil him.”</p>

<p>“He can barely walk.”</p>

<p>“And he shouldn’t walk any more
than is necessary. The vet said that’s the most important thing for his
recovery, to keep him off his leg as much as possible. All walks have to be
on-leash. And no stairs. We have to keep him on the first floor.”</p>

<p>“But how will he come up to bed?”</p>

<p>“He’s going to have to sleep down
here.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll go up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. He knows how
weak his leg is.”</p>

<p>“He’ll go up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put some books on the stairs
to block the way.”</p>

<p>Sam set his alarm for 2:00 a.m., to
go down and check on Argus. He snoozed once, and then again, but with the third
buzz, his guilt was awakened. He plodded down the stairs, only half aware of
being out of bed, nearly paralyzed himself with the help of the stacked Grove
Encyclopedia of Art, and found his father on top of a sleeping bag, spooning
Argus. That’s when he cried. Not because he loved his dad—although in that
moment he certainly did—but because, of the two animals on the floor, it was
his dad he felt more sorry for.</p>

<p>&gt; Look at you, Bar Mitzvah.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>He was by the window. The cousins
were on PlayStation, killing representations. The adults were upstairs, eating
the disgusting, smelly, smoked, and gelatinous foods Jews suddenly need in
times of reflection. No one noticed him, which was what he wanted, even if it
wasn’t what he needed.</p>

<p>He wasn’t crying about anything in
front of him—not the death of his great-grandfather or the death of Noam’s
avatar, not the collapse of his parents’ marriage, or the collapse of his bar
mitzvah, or the collapsed buildings in Israel. His tears were reaching back. It
took Noam’s moment of kindness to reveal the yawning absence of kindness. His
dad had slept on the floor for thirty-eight days. (The extra week to play it
safe.) Was it easier to extend such kindness to a dog because it didn’t risk
rejection? Or because the needs of animals are so animalistic, whereas the
needs of humans are so human?</p>

<p>He might never become a man, but
crying at that window—his great-grandfather completely alone in the earth
twenty minutes away; an avatar returning to pixelated dust in some refrigerated
data storage center somewhere near nothing; his parents just on the other side
of the ceiling, but a ceiling without edges—Sam was reborn.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>JUST THE WAILING</h2>

<p>Judaism gets death right, Jacob
thought. It instructs us what to do when we know least well what to do, and
feel an overwhelming need to do something. You should sit like this. We will.
You should dress like this. We will. You should say these words at these
moments, even if you have to read from transliteration. Na-ah-seh.</p>

<p>Jacob had stopped crying more than
an hour ago, but he still had what Benjy called “after-crying breath.” Irv
brought him a glass of peach schnapps, said, “I told the rabbi he was welcome
to come, but I doubt he’ll come,” and went back to his windowsill citadel.</p>

<p>The dining table was covered with
platters of food: everything and pumpernickel bagels, everything minibagels,
everything flagels, bialys, cream cheese, scallion cream cheese, salmon spread,
tofu spread, smoked and pickled fish, pitch-black brownies with white chocolate
swirls like square universes, blondies, rugelach, out-of-season hamantaschen
(strawberry, prune, and poppy seed), and “salads”—Jews apply the word salad to
anything that can’t be held in one’s hand: cucumber salad, whitefish and tuna
and baked salmon salad, lentil salad, pasta salad, quinoa salad. And there was
purple soda, and black coffee, and Diet Coke, and black tea, and enough seltzer
to float an aircraft carrier, and Kedem grape juice—a liquid more Jewish than
Jewish blood. And there were pickles, a few kinds. Capers don’t belong in any
food, but the capers that every spoon had tried to avoid had found their way
into foods in which they really didn’t belong, like someone’s half-empty
half-decaf. And at the center of the table, impossibly dense kugels bent light
and time around them. It was too much food by a factor of ten. But it had to
be.</p>

<p>Relatives exchanged stories about
Isaac while they piled their plates toward the ceiling of the floor above. They
laughed about how funny he was (on purpose, and by accident), what an obstinate
pain in the ass he could be (on purpose, and by accident). They reflected on
what a hero he had been (on purpose, and by accident). There was a bit of
crying, there were some awkward silences, there was gratitude for having had an
occasion to gather as a family (some of the cousins hadn’t seen each other
since Leah’s bat mitzvah, some not since Great-Aunt Doris’s death), and
everyone looked at his phone: to check on the war, the score of the game, the
weather.</p>

<p>The kids, having already forgotten
about any first-person sadness they might have felt over Isaac’s death, were
playing first-person video games in the basement. Max’s pulse doubled as he
spectated at an assassination attempt by someone he thought was a second
cousin. Sam sat off to the side with his iPad, wandering in a virtual lemon
grove. This was how it always went, this vertical segregation. And inevitably,
the adults with enough sense to escape the adult world would migrate down.
Which is what Jacob did.</p>

<p>There were at least a dozen
cousins—many from Deborah’s side, a few from Julia’s. The younger ones unpacked
all the board games, one at a time—not to play them, but to unpack them and
commingle the small pieces. Every now and then one would spontaneously freak
out. The older cousins were surrounding Barak as he performed virtuosic acts of
extreme violence on a TV so large one had to sit against the opposite wall to
see its edges.</p>

<p>Benjy was on his own, stuffing
crumpled Monopoly money between the venetian blinds.</p>

<p>“You’re being very generous with
the window,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“It’s not real money.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“I know you’re joking.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen Mom around, have
you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Hey?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Have you been crying, buddy?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure? You look like you
have.”</p>

<p>“Holy shit!” a cousin shouted.</p>

<p>“Language!” Jacob shouted back.</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“Are you sad about Great-Grandpa?”</p>

<p>“Not really.”</p>

<p>“So what’s upsetting you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Dads know these things.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you know what’s
upsetting me?”</p>

<p>“Dads don’t know everything.”</p>

<p>“Only God does.”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Schneiderman.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?”</p>

<p>“My Hebrew school teacher.”</p>

<p>“Schneiderman. Right.”</p>

<p>“He said that God knows everything.
But that didn’t make sense to me.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make sense to me,
either.”</p>

<p>“But that’s because you don’t
believe in God.”</p>

<p>“I only ever said I was unsure. But
if I did believe in God, it still wouldn’t make sense to me.”</p>

<p>“Right, because if God knows
everything, why do we have to write notes to put in the Wall?”</p>

<p>“That’s a good point.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Schneiderman said that God
knows everything but sometimes forgets. So the notes are to remind him of
what’s important.”</p>

<p>“God forgets? Really?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he said.”</p>

<p>“What do you think about that?”</p>

<p>“It’s weird.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too.”</p>

<p>“But that’s because you don’t
believe in God.”</p>

<p>“If I believed in God, he would be
a remembering God.”</p>

<p>“Mine would, too.”</p>

<p>Despite being as agnostic about
God’s existence as he was about the question’s meaning (could any two people
really be referring to the same thing when speaking about God?), Jacob wanted
Benjy to believe. Or Dr. Silvers did, anyway. For several months, Benjy’s
anxiety about death had been slowly and steadily ramping up, and now risked
tipping from adorable to problematic. Dr. Silvers said, “He has the rest of his
life to form answers to theological questions, but he’ll never get back this
time of developing his first relationship to the world. Just make him feel
safe.” That struck Jacob as right, even if the thought of evangelizing made him
squirm. The next time Benjy raised his fear of death, just when Jacob’s
instinct urged him to agree that an eternity of nonexistence was certainly the
most horrible of all things to imagine, Jacob remembered Dr. Silvers’s command:
Just make him feel safe.</p>

<p>“Well, you know about heaven,
right?” Jacob said, causing a nonexistent angel to lose its wings.</p>

<p>“I know that you think it isn’t
real.”</p>

<p>“Well, no one knows for sure. I
certainly don’t. But you know what heaven is?”</p>

<p>“Not really.”</p>

<p>So Jacob gave his most comforting
explanation, sparing neither extravagance nor intellectual integrity.</p>

<p>“And if I wanted to stay up late in
heaven?” Benjy asked, now planking on the sofa.</p>

<p>“As late as you want,” Jacob said,
“every single night.”</p>

<p>“And I could probably eat dessert
before dinner.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have to eat dinner at
all.”</p>

<p>“But then I wouldn’t be healthy.”</p>

<p>“Health won’t matter.”</p>

<p>Benjy turned his head to the side:
“Birthdays.”</p>

<p>“What about them?”</p>

<p>“What are they like?”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re never-ending, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Wait, it’s always your birthday?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You have a party and get presents
every day?”</p>

<p>“All day every day.”</p>

<p>“Wait, do you have to write
thank-you notes?”</p>

<p>“You don’t even have to say thank
you.”</p>

<p>“Wait, does that mean you’re zero,
or infinity?”</p>

<p>“What do you want to be?”</p>

<p>“Infinity.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re infinity.”</p>

<p>“Wait, is it always everyone’s
birthday?”</p>

<p>“Only yours.”</p>

<p>Benjy rose to his feet, raised his
hands above his head, and said, “I want to die right now!”</p>

<p>Just don’t make him feel too safe.</p>

<p>In Irv and Deborah’s basement,
facing a more nuanced theological question, Jacob again resisted his instinct
for truth in favor of Benjy’s emotional safety: “Maybe God does remember
everything but sometimes chooses to forget?”</p>

<p>“Why would he do that?”</p>

<p>“So that we remember,” Jacob said,
pleased with his improvisation. “Like the wishes,” he continued. “If God knew
what we wanted, we wouldn’t have to.”</p>

<p>“And God wants us to know for
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Could be.”</p>

<p>“I used to think Great-Grandpa was God,”
Benjy said.</p>

<p>“You did?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but he’s dead, so obviously
he wasn’t God.”</p>

<p>“That’s one way to think about it.”</p>

<p>“I know Mom isn’t God.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“Because she would never forget
about me.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Jacob said, “she
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“No matter what.”</p>

<p>“No matter what.”</p>

<p>Another round of expletive
mutterings from the cousins.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Benjy said, “that’s what
was making me cry.”</p>

<p>“Mom?”</p>

<p>“My note for the Wailing Wall.”</p>

<p>“Because you were thinking about
how God is forgetful?”</p>

<p>“No,” Benjy said, pointing at the
TV, which wasn’t displaying a video game, as Jacob had thought, but the effects
of the most recent, and most severe, aftershock, “because the Wall crumbled.”</p>

<p>“The Wall?”</p>

<p>They came spilling into the world:
every wish tucked into every crevice, but also every wish tucked into every
Jew’s heart.</p>

<p>“No more proof of how great they
were,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The thing you told me about the
Romans.”</p>

<p>How much do the children know, and
how much do they remember?</p>

<p>“Jacob!” Irv called from upstairs.</p>

<p>“The Wailing Wall,” Jacob said, as
if by saying its name aloud, it would exist again.</p>

<p>Jacob could make his children feel
safe. But could he keep them safe?</p>

<p>Benjy shook his head and said, “Now
it’s just the Wailing.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>LOOK! A CRYING HEBREW BABY</h2>

<p>Tamir’s presence had not only made
a full reckoning impossible, it required Julia to be a buoyant host. And the
death of Jacob’s grandfather required her to at least perform love and care,
when all she felt was sadness and doubt. She was good enough to manage her blossoming
resentment, good enough, even, to suppress her passive-aggression, but at a
certain point, the requirements of being a good person inspire hatred for
oneself and others.</p>

<p>Like any living person, she had
fantasies. (Although her immense guilt about being human required a constant
reminder—that she was “like any living person.”) The houses she designed were
fantasies, but there were others.</p>

<p>She imagined a week alone in Big
Sur. Maybe at the Post Ranch Inn, maybe one of the ocean-facing rooms. Maybe a
massage, maybe a facial, maybe a “treatment” that treats nothing. Maybe she’d
walk through a redwood tunnel, the growth rings bending around her.</p>

<p>She imagined having a personal
chef. Vegans live longer, and are healthier, and have better skin, and she
could do that; it would be easy, if someone shopped, cooked, and cleaned for
her.</p>

<p>She imagined Mark noticing small
things about her that she’d never noticed about herself: lovably misused
idioms, what her feet do when she flosses, her funny relationship to dessert
menus.</p>

<p>She imagined going for walks
without destinations, thinking about things of no logistical importance, like
whether Edison bulbs are actually obnoxious.</p>

<p>She imagined a secret admirer
anonymously subscribing her to a magazine.</p>

<p>She imagined the disappearance of
crow’s feet, like the disappearance of crow’s footprints from a dusty road.</p>

<p>She imagined the disappearance of
screens—from her life, from her children’s lives. From the gym, from doctors’
offices and the backs of cabs, hanging behind bars and in the corners of
diners, the iWatches of people holding iPads on the Metro.</p>

<p>She imagined the deaths of her
air-filled clients and their dreams of heavier and heavier kitchen appliances.</p>

<p>She fantasized about the death of
the so-called teacher who chuckled at one of Max’s answers four years ago,
requiring a month of bedtime talks to reinstill his enjoyment of school.</p>

<p>Dr. Silvers would have to die at
least a couple of times.</p>

<p>She imagined Jacob’s sudden
disappearance—from the house, from existence. She imagined him dropping dead at
the gym. Which required imagining him going to the gym. Which required
imagining him once again possessing a desire to be attractive in ways other
than professional success.</p>

<p>Of course, she didn’t actually want
him to die, no part of her did, not even subconsciously, and when she
fantasized about his death, it was always painless. Sometimes he would panic in
awareness as he tried to reach through his chest to grab his stammering heart.
Sometimes he would think of the children. The end of sometimes: he would be
gone forever. And she would be alone, and finally unalone, and people would
grieve for her.</p>

<p>She would cook all the meals (as
she already did), do all the cleaning (as she already did), buy the graph paper
for Benjy’s solutionless mazes, the teriyaki-roasted seaweed snacks for Max, a
cool-but-not-trying-too-hard messenger bag for Sam when the last one she bought
for him fell apart. She would dress them in end-of-the-year Zara and Crewcuts
sale clothing and get them off to school (as she already did). She would have
to support herself (which she couldn’t, with her present lifestyle, but
wouldn’t have to, given Jacob’s life insurance policy). Her imagination was
strong enough to hurt her. She was weak enough to keep the hurt to herself.</p>

<p>And then came the most hurtful
thought, the thought that can never be touched with even the whorls of the
fingers of one’s brain: the deaths of her children. She’d had the most horrible
thought many times since she became pregnant with Sam: imagined miscarriages;
imagined SIDS; imagined tumbles down stairs, trying to shield his body from the
treads as they fell; imagined cancer every time she saw a child with cancer.
There was the knowledge that every school bus she ever put one of her children
on was going to roll down the side of a hill and into a frozen lake, whose ice
would re-form around its silhouette. Every time one of her children was put
under general anesthesia, she said goodbye to him as if she were saying goodbye
to him. She wasn’t naturally anxious, much less apocalyptic, but Jacob was
right when, after Sam’s injury, he said it was too much love for happiness.</p>

<p>Sam’s injury. It was the place she
was unwilling to go, because there was no road back. And yet the trauma center
of her brain was always pushing her there. And she was always never fully
returning. She’d found peace with why it happened—there was no why—but not how.
It was too painful, because whatever the sequence of events, it wasn’t
necessary or inevitable. Jacob never asked her if she had been the one to open
the door. (It was far too heavy for Sam to have opened himself.) Julia never
asked Jacob if he had closed it on Sam’s fingers. (Maybe Sam could have gotten
it moving, and inertia would have taken care of the rest?) It was five years
ago, and the journey—the century-long morning in the ER, the twice-a-week
visits to the plastic surgeon, the year of rehab—brought them closer than
they’d ever been. But it also created a black hole of silence, from which
everything had to keep a safe distance, into which so much was swallowed, a
teaspoon of which weighed more than a million suns consuming a million photos
of a million families on a million moons.</p>

<p>They could talk about how lucky
they were (Sam very nearly lost his fingers), but never how unlucky. They could
speak in generalities, but never recount the details: Dr. Fred repeatedly
sticking needles into Sam’s fingers to test for feeling, while Sam looked into
his parents’ eyes and begged, pleaded, for it to stop. When they came home,
Jacob put his bloody shirt in a plastic bag and walked it to the garbage can on
the corner of Connecticut. Julia put her bloody shirt in an old pillowcase and
tucked it halfway into a stack of pants.</p>

<p>Too much love for happiness, but
how much happiness was enough? Would she do it all again? She always believed
that her ability to endure pain was greater than anyone else’s—certainly than
her children’s or Jacob’s. A burden would be easiest carried by her, and
regardless, it would ultimately be carried by her anyway. Only men can unhave
babies. But if she could do it all again?</p>

<p>She often thought of those retired
Japanese engineers who volunteered to go into failing nuclear plants to fix
them after the tsunami. They knew they’d be exposed to fatal amounts of
radiation, but given that their life expectancies were shorter than the time it
would take for the cancer to kill them, they saw no reason not to get the
cancer. In the hardware gallery, Mark had said it wasn’t too late in life for
happiness. When, in Julia’s life, would it be late enough for honesty?</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>It was amazing how little changed
as everything changed. The conversation was continually expanding, but it was
no longer clear what they were talking about. When Jacob showed her listings
for places to which he might move, was it any more real than when he used to
show her listings for places to which they might move? When they shared their
visions for happy independent lives, was it any less make-believe than when
they used to share their visions for living together happily? The rehearsal of
how they would tell the kids took on a quality of theater, as if they were
trying to get the scene right, rather than get life right. She had the sense
that to Jacob it was a kind of game, that he enjoyed it. Or worse, that
planning their separation was a new ritual that kept them together.</p>

<p>Domestic life stagnated. They
talked about Jacob starting to sleep elsewhere, but Tamir was in the guest
room, Barak was on the sofa, and leaving for a hotel after everyone was asleep
and arriving before anyone woke up felt both cruel and profligate. They talked
and talked about what kind of schedule was most likely to facilitate good
stretches with the kids, and good transitions, and as little missing as
possible—but they didn’t take any steps either to repair what was broken or to
leave it behind.</p>

<p>After the funeral …</p>

<p>After the bar mitzvah …</p>

<p>After the Israelis leave …</p>

<p>After the semester ends …</p>

<p>There was a nonchalance to their
desperation, and maybe talking about it was enough for now. It could wait until
it couldn’t.</p>

<p>But funerals, like airplane
turbulence and fortieth birthdays, force the issue of mortality. Had it been
another day, she and Jacob would have found ways to continue living inside
their purgatory. They would have created errands to run, diversions, emotional
escape hatches, fantasies. The funeral made a conversation almost a crime, but
it also inspired an unrelenting questioning in Julia. All that could be
deferred on any other day was now urgent. She remembered Max’s obsession with
time, how little there was. “I’m wasting my life!”</p>

<p>She went to the bedroom, to the
dozens of coats piled on the bed. They looked like dead bodies, like Jewish
dead. Those images had imprinted Julia’s childhood, too, and she now found
certain resonances impossible to escape. Those images of naked women holding
their children to their chests. She hadn’t seen them since she first saw them,
but she never stopped seeing them.</p>

<p>The rabbi had looked across the
patiently waiting grave and into Julia. He asked, “But in your experience, do
Jews cry silently?” Did he see what no one could hear?</p>

<p>She found her coat, put it on. The
pockets were filled with receipts, and a small arsenal of candies for bribing,
and keys, and business cards, and assorted foreign currency from trips she
could remember planning and packing for but not taking. In two fistfuls she
transferred all this to the garbage, like tashlich.</p>

<p>She went to the front door without
stopping: past the white cabbage salad, black coffee, bluefish, and blondies;
past the purple soda and peach schnapps; past the chatter about investments,
and Israel, and cancer. She walked past the drone of the Mourner’s Kaddish,
past the covered mirrors, past the photos of Isaac on the console: with the
Israelis at their last visit; at Julia’s fortieth; on his sofa, looking off
into the near distance. When she reached the door, she noticed, for the first
time, the sign-in book resting open on an accent table. She flipped through it,
looking to see if her boys had written anything.</p>

<p>Sam: I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Max: I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Benjy: I’m sorry.</p>

<p>She was sorry, too, and she touched
the mezuzah as she crossed the threshold, but didn’t kiss her fingers. She
remembered when Jacob suggested they select their own text to scroll into the
mezuzah of the front door of their home. They chose a line from the Talmud:
“Every blade of grass has an angel watching over it, whispering, ‘Grow! Grow!’”
Would the next family to live in the house even know?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE LION’S DEN</h2>

<p>Tamir and Jacob stayed up late that
night. Julia was somewhere, but she wasn’t there. Isaac wasn’t there, wasn’t
anywhere. The kids were supposed to be asleep in their rooms, but Sam was in
Other Life while snapchatting with Billie, and Max was looking up words that he
didn’t understand in The Catcher in the Rye—pissed, as Holden had taught him to
be, that he had to use a paper dictionary. Barak was in the guest room, asleep
and expanding. Downstairs, it was only the two cousins—old friends, middle-aged
men, the fathers of still-young children.</p>

<p>Jacob got some beers from the
gently humming fridge, muted the TV, and with a heavy, affected sigh took a
seat across the table from Tamir.</p>

<p>“That was hard today.”</p>

<p>“He lived a good, long life,” Tamir
said, and then took a good, long drink.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Jacob said, “except
for the good part.”</p>

<p>“The great-grandchildren.”</p>

<p>“Whom he referred to as his
‘revenge against the German people.’”</p>

<p>“Revenge is sweet.”</p>

<p>“He spent his days clipping coupons
for things he would never buy, while telling anyone who would listen that no
one listened to him.” A drink. “I once took the kids to a zoo in Berlin—”</p>

<p>“You’ve been to Berlin?”</p>

<p>“We were shooting there, and it
coincided with a school break.”</p>

<p>“You’ve taken your children to
Berlin and not to Israel?”</p>

<p>“As I was saying, we went to a zoo
in the East, and it was pretty much the most depressing place I’ve ever been. There
was a panther, in a habitat the size of a handicapped parking space, with flora
about as convincing as a plastic Chinese food display. He was walking figure
eights, over and over and over, the exact same path. When he turned, he would
jerk his head back and squint. Every time. We were mesmerized. Sam, who was
maybe seven, pressed his palms to the glass and asked, ‘When is Great-Grandpa’s
birthday?’ Julia and I looked at each other. What kind of seven-year-old asks
such a question at such a moment?”</p>

<p>“The kind who worries that his
great-grandfather is a depressed panther.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And he was right. The
same routine, day after day after day: instant black coffee and cantaloupe;
crawl through the Jewish Week with that enormous magnifying glass; check the
house to make sure all the lights are still off; push a walker on tennis balls
to shul to have the same Sad Libs conversations with the same macular
degenerates, substituting different names into the news about prognoses and
graduations; thaw a brick of chicken soup while flipping through the same photo
albums; eat the soup with black bread while advancing through another paragraph
of the Jewish Week; take a nap in front of one of the same five movies; walk
across the street to confirm Mr. Kowalski’s continued existence; skip dinner;
check the house to make sure all the lights are still off; go to bed at seven
and have eleven hours of the same nightmares. Is that happiness?”</p>

<p>“It’s a version.”</p>

<p>“Not one that anyone would choose.”</p>

<p>“A lot of people would choose
that.”</p>

<p>Jacob thought of Isaac’s brothers,
of hungry refugees, of survivors who didn’t even have family to ignore them—he
was ashamed both of the inadequate life he tolerated for his great-grandfather
and of judging it inadequate.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you took the kids
to Berlin,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“It’s an incredible city.”</p>

<p>“But before Israel?”</p>

<p>Google knew how far Tel Aviv was
from Washington, and a tape measure could determine the width of the table, but
Jacob couldn’t even approximate his emotional distance from Tamir. He wondered:
Do we understand each other? Or are we near-strangers, just assuming and
pretending?</p>

<p>“I regret that we didn’t keep in
better touch,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“You and Isaac?”</p>

<p>“No. Us.”</p>

<p>“I suppose if we’d wanted to, we
would have.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” Jacob said.
“There are a lot of things I wanted to do, but didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Wanted at the time, or looking
back?”</p>

<p>“Hard to say.”</p>

<p>“Hard to know? Or hard to say?”</p>

<p>Jacob swallowed a mouthful of beer
and used his palm to dry the ring left on the table, wishing, as he did, that
he were the kind of person to let such things go. He thought about all that was
happening behind the walls, above the ceiling, and under the floor—how little
he understood the workings of his home. What was going on at the outlet when
nothing was plugged in? Was there water in the pipes at that moment? There must
have been, as it came out as soon as the faucet was opened. So did that mean
the house was constantly filled with sitting water? Wouldn’t that weigh an enormous
amount? When he’d learned in school that his body was more than sixty percent
water, he’d done as his father had taught, and doubted. Water simply wasn’t
heavy enough for that to be true. Then he’d done as his father had taught, and
sought the truth from his father. Irv filled a trash bin with water and
challenged Jacob to lift it. As Jacob struggled, Irv said: “You should feel
blood.”</p>

<p>Jacob brought the beer to his lips.
There were images of the Wailing Wall on the TV. He leaned back and said,
“Remember when we snuck out of my parents’ house? Years and years ago?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“When we went to the National Zoo?”</p>

<p>“The National Zoo?”</p>

<p>“Really?” Jacob asked. “A few
nights before my bar mitzvah?”</p>

<p>“Of course I remember. You’re not
remembering that I mentioned it in the car on the way from the airport. And it
was the night before your bar mitzvah. Not a few nights before.”</p>

<p>“Right. I know. I knew. I don’t
know why I changed it like that.”</p>

<p>“What would your Dr. Silvers say?”</p>

<p>“I’m impressed you remember his
name.”</p>

<p>“You’ve made it easy.”</p>

<p>“What would Dr. Silvers say?
Probably that I was protecting myself with the vagueness.”</p>

<p>“How much do you pay this man?”</p>

<p>“I pay him a preposterous shitload.
And insurance pays the other two-thirds.”</p>

<p>“Protecting yourself from what?”</p>

<p>“From caring more?”</p>

<p>“Than I do?”</p>

<p>“I’m not making an argument for my
enlightenment here.”</p>

<p>And not only behind the walls,
above the ceiling, and under the floor—the room itself was filled with activity
of which Jacob had only the dimmest awareness: radio broadcasts, TV stations,
cell phone conversations, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, leakage from the microwave,
radiation from the oven and lightbulbs, solar rays from the biggest oven and
lightbulb of them all. All of it constantly passing through the room, some of
it cultivating tumors or killing sperm, none of it noticed.</p>

<p>“We were so dumb,” Tamir chuckled.</p>

<p>“We still are.”</p>

<p>“But we were even dumber then.”</p>

<p>“But we were also romantic.”</p>

<p>“Romantic?”</p>

<p>“About life. Don’t you remember
what that was like? To believe that life itself could be the object of love?”</p>

<p>While Tamir went for another beer,
Jacob texted Julia: where are you? i called maggie and she said you weren’t
there.</p>

<p>“No,” Tamir said into the fridge.
“I don’t remember that.”</p>

<p>Their socks had become sweat
sponges at the zoo that morning thirty years before. Everything in D.C. in the
summer was a purification ritual. They saw the famous pandas, Ling-Ling and
Hsing-Hsing, the elephants and their memories, the porcupines and their shields
of writing implements. The parents argued about which city’s weather was less
sufferable, D.C.’s or Haifa’s. Each wanted to lose, because losing was how you
won. Tamir, who was a highly significant six months older than Jacob, spent
most of the time pointing out how little security there was, how easy it would
be to sneak in, perhaps not realizing that the zoo was open, and they were
there, and it was free.</p>

<p>After the zoo, they took
Connecticut Avenue to Dupont Circle—Irv and Shlomo up front, Adina and Deborah
in the back, Jacob and Tamir facing backward in the Volvo’s rear—had sandwiches
at an unmemorable café, then spent the afternoon at the National Air and Space
Museum waiting in line for the twenty-seven glorious minutes of To Fly!</p>

<p>To make up for the crappy lunch,
they went to Armand’s that evening for “the best Chicago pizza in D.C.,” then
had sundaes at Swensen’s, then watched a dull action movie at the Uptown, just
to experience the awe of a screen so big it felt like the opposite of being
buried, and maybe even the opposite of dying.</p>

<p>Five hours later, the only light
coming from the security system’s keypad, Tamir shook Jacob into wakefulness.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” Tamir whispered.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Come on.”</p>

<p>“I’m asleep.”</p>

<p>“Sleeping people don’t talk.”</p>

<p>“It’s called talking in one’s
sleep.”</p>

<p>“We’re going.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“The zoo.”</p>

<p>“What zoo?”</p>

<p>“Come on, shithead.”</p>

<p>“It’s my bar mitzvah tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Today.”</p>

<p>“Right. And I need to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Sleep during your bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“Why would we go to the zoo?”</p>

<p>“To sneak in.”</p>

<p>“Why would we do that?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a pussy.”</p>

<p>Maybe Jacob’s common sense was
still offline, or maybe he actually cared about being a pussy in Tamir’s
estimation, but he sat up, rubbed his eyes, and put on his clothes. A phrase
formed in his mind—this is so unlike me—that he would find himself repeating
throughout the night, until the moment he became his own opposite.</p>

<p>They walked down Newark in the
darkness, took a right at the Cleveland Park branch of the public library.
Silently, more like sleepwalkers than Mossad agents, they padded down
Connecticut, over the Klingle Valley Bridge (which Jacob was incapable of
crossing without imagining jumping), past the Kennedy-Warren apartments. They
were awake, but it was a dream. They came to the verdigris lion and the large
concrete letters: ZOO.</p>

<p>Tamir had been right: nothing could
have been easier than hopping the waist-high concrete barrier. It was so easy
as to feel like a trap. Jacob would have been happy enough to cross the border,
make the transgression official, and turn right back around, newly acquired
trespassing badge in trembling hand. But Tamir wasn’t content with the story.</p>

<p>Like a tiny commando, Tamir
crouched, searched his field of vision, then gave Jacob a quick beckoning
gesture to follow. And Jacob followed. Tamir led him past the welcome kiosk,
past the orientation map, farther and farther away from the street, until they
lost sight of it, as sailors lose sight of the shore. Jacob didn’t know where
Tamir was leading him, but he knew that he was being led, and would follow. This
is so unlike me.</p>

<p>The animals, as far as Jacob could
tell, were asleep. The only sounds were the wind moving through the copious
bamboo, and the ghostly buzzing vending machines. Earlier, the zoo had
resembled an arcade on Labor Day. Now it felt like the middle of the ocean.</p>

<p>Animals were always mysteries to
Jacob, but never more than when they slept. It felt possible to outline—if only
a crude, gross approximation—the consciousness of a waking animal. But what
does a rhinoceros dream about? Does a rhinoceros dream? A waking animal never
startled into sleep—it happened slowly, peacefully. But a sleeping animal
seemed always on the verge of startling into wakefulness, into violence.</p>

<p>They reached the lion enclosure and
Tamir stopped. “I haven’t stopped thinking about this since we were here this
morning.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>He put his hands on the rail and
said, “I want to touch the ground.”</p>

<p>“You are touching the ground.”</p>

<p>“In there.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“For a second.”</p>

<p>“Fuck you.”</p>

<p>“I’m serious.”</p>

<p>“No you’re not.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re fucking crazy.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I’m also fucking
serious.”</p>

<p>Tamir had taken them, Jacob then
realized, to the only part of the enclosure where the wall was short enough for
some DSM-5 exemplar to be able to climb back out. He’d obviously found it earlier
in the day, maybe even measured it with his eyes, maybe—certainly—played out
the scene in his mind.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because you know why not.”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Because you will be eaten by a
lion, Tamir. Jesus fucking Christ.”</p>

<p>“They’re asleep,” he said.</p>

<p>“They?”</p>

<p>“There’s three of them.”</p>

<p>“You counted?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And it also says so on the
plaque.”</p>

<p>“They’re asleep because nobody is
invading their territory.”</p>

<p>“And they’re not even out here.
They’re inside.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Do you see them?”</p>

<p>“I’m not a fucking zoologist. Of
all the things that are going on right now, I probably see about none of them.”</p>

<p>“They’re asleep inside.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go home. I’ll tell everyone
you jumped in. I’ll tell them you killed a lion, or got a blowjob from a lion,
or whatever will make you feel like a hero, but let’s get the fuck out of
here.”</p>

<p>“Nothing I want here has to do with
anyone else.”</p>

<p>Tamir had already begun to hoist
himself over.</p>

<p>“You’re going to die,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“So are you,” Tamir responded.</p>

<p>“What am I supposed to do if a lion
wakes up and starts running for you?”</p>

<p>“What are you supposed to do?”</p>

<p>That made Jacob laugh. And his
laughter made Tamir laugh. With his small joke, the tension eased. With his
small joke, the stupidest of all ideas became reasonable, even almost sensible,
maybe even genius. The alternative—sanity—became insane. Because they were
young. Because one is young only once in a life lived only once. Because
recklessness is the only fist to throw at nothingness. How much aliveness can
one bear?</p>

<p>It happened so quickly, and took
forever. Tamir jumped down, landing with a thud he obviously didn’t anticipate,
because his eyes met Jacob’s with a flash of terror. And as if the ground were
lava, he tried to get off it. He wasn’t quite able to reach the rail on his
first jump, but the second try looked easy. He pulled himself up, Jacob hoisted
him over the glass, and together they fell onto the pavement, laughing.</p>

<p>What did Jacob feel, laughing with
his cousin? He was laughing at life. Laughing at himself. Even a
thirteen-year-old knows the thrill and terror of his own insignificance.
Especially a thirteen-year-old.</p>

<p>“Now you,” Tamir said as they
picked themselves up and brushed themselves off.</p>

<p>“No fucking way.”</p>

<p>This is so unlike me.</p>

<p>“Come on.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather die.”</p>

<p>“You can have it both ways. Come
on, you have to.”</p>

<p>“Because you did it?”</p>

<p>“Because you want to do it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said. “You’ll be so
happy. For years you’ll be happy.”</p>

<p>“Happiness isn’t that important to
me.”</p>

<p>And then, firmly: “Now, Jacob.”</p>

<p>Jacob tried to laugh off Tamir’s
flash of aggressiveness.</p>

<p>“My parents would kill me if I died
before my bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“This will be your bar mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“No way.”</p>

<p>And then Tamir got up in Jacob’s
face. “I’m going to punch you if you don’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Give me a break.”</p>

<p>“I am literally going to punch
you.”</p>

<p>“But I have glasses and acne.”</p>

<p>That small joke diffused nothing,
made nothing almost sensible. Tamir punched Jacob in the chest, hard enough to
send him into the railing. It was the first time Jacob had ever been punched.</p>

<p>“What the fuck, Tamir?”</p>

<p>“What are you crying about?”</p>

<p>“I’m not crying.”</p>

<p>“If you’re not crying, then stop
crying.”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>Tamir rested a hand on each of
Jacob’s shoulders, and rested his forehead against Jacob’s. Jacob had
breast-fed for a year, been given baths in the kitchen sink, fallen asleep on
his father’s shoulder a thousand times—but this was an intimacy he had never
experienced.</p>

<p>“You have to do it,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“You do, but you’re afraid.”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>But he did. But he was afraid.</p>

<p>“Come,” Tamir said, bringing Jacob
to the wall. “It’s easy. It will take only a second. You saw. You saw that it
wasn’t a big deal. And you’ll remember it forever.”</p>

<p>This is so unlike me.</p>

<p>“Dead people don’t have memories.”</p>

<p>“I won’t let you die.”</p>

<p>“No? What will you do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll jump in with you.”</p>

<p>“So we die together?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t make me any less
dead.”</p>

<p>“It does. Now go.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear something?”</p>

<p>“No, because there was nothing to
hear.”</p>

<p>“Seriously: I don’t want to die.”</p>

<p>Somehow it happened without
happening, without any decision having been made, without a brain sending any
signal to any muscle. At a certain point, Jacob was halfway over the glass,
without ever having climbed it. His hands were shaking so violently he could
only barely hold on.</p>

<p>This is so unlike me.</p>

<p>“Let go,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>He held on.</p>

<p>This is so unlike me.</p>

<p>“Let go.”</p>

<p>He shook his head and let go.</p>

<p>And then he was on the ground,
inside the lion’s den.</p>

<p>This is the opposite of me.</p>

<p>There, on the dirt, in the middle
of the simulated savannah, in the middle of the nation’s capital, he felt
something so irrepressible and true that it would either save or ruin his life.</p>

<p>Three years later he would touch
his tongue to the tongue of a girl for whom he so happily would have cut off
his arms, if only she had let him. And the following year an air bag would tear
his cornea and save his life. Two years after that he would gaze with amazement
at a mouth around his penis. And later that year he would say to his father
what for years he had been saying about him. He would smoke a bushel of pot,
watch his knee bend the wrong way during a stupid touch-football game, be
inexplicably moved to tears in a foreign city by a painting of a woman and her
baby, touch a hibernating brown bear and an endangered pangolin, spend a week
waiting for a test result, pray silently for his wife’s life as she screamed as
new life came out of her body—many moments when life felt big, precious. But
they made up such an utterly small portion of his time on earth: Five minutes a
year? What did it sum to? A day? At most? A day of feeling alive in four
decades of life?</p>

<p>Inside the lion’s den, he felt
surrounded and embraced by his own existence. He felt, perhaps for the first
time in his life, safe.</p>

<p>But then he heard it, and was
brought back. He looked up, met Tamir’s eyes, and could see that Tamir heard
it, too. A stirring. Flattening foliage. What did they exchange in their
glance? Fear? But it felt like laughter. Like the greatest of all jokes had
passed between them.</p>

<p>Jacob turned and saw an animal. Not
in his mind, but an actual animal in the actual world. An animal that didn’t
deliberate and expound. An uncircumcised animal. It was fifty feet away, but
its hot breath was steaming Jacob’s glasses.</p>

<p>Without saying a word, Tamir
climbed back over the fence and extended his hand. Jacob leaped for it but
couldn’t reach. Their fingers touched, which made the distance feel infinite.
Jacob jumped again, and again their fingertips brushed, and now the lion was
running, halving the distance between them with each stride. Jacob had no time
to gather himself or contemplate how he might get an extra inch or two, he
simply tried again, and this time—because of the adrenaline, or because of God’s
sudden desire to prove His existence—he caught hold of Tamir’s wrist.</p>

<p>And then Jacob and Tamir were once
again sprawled on the pavement, and Tamir started laughing, and Jacob started
laughing, and then, or at the same time, Jacob started crying.</p>

<p>Maybe he knew. Maybe he was somehow
aware, a teenager laughing and crying on that pavement, that he would never
again feel anything like it. Maybe he saw, from the peak of that mountaintop,
the great flatness before him.</p>

<p>Tamir was crying, too.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, they were still
on the brink of the enclosure, but despite all the inches they’d grown, it no
longer felt possible to enter. The glass had grown, too. It had grown more than
they’d grown.</p>

<p>“I’ve never felt alive since that
night,” Jacob said, bringing Tamir another beer.</p>

<p>“Life has been that boring?”</p>

<p>“No. A lot of life has happened.
But I haven’t felt it.</p>

<p>“There are versions of happiness,”
Tamir said.</p>

<p>Jacob paused before opening the
bottle and said, “You know, I’m not sure I believe that.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to believe it. You
want to believe that your work should have the significance of a war, that a
long marriage should offer the same kind of excitement as a first date.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Jacob said. “Don’t expect
too much. Learn to love the numbness.”</p>

<p>“That’s not what I said.”</p>

<p>“I’ve spent my life clinging to the
belief that all the things we spoke about as children had at least a grain of
truth to them. That the promise of a felt life isn’t a lie.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever stop to ask yourself
why you put such an emphasis on feeling?”</p>

<p>“What else would one put an
emphasis on?”</p>

<p>“Peace.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got plenty of peace,” Jacob
said. “Too much peace.”</p>

<p>“There are versions of peace, too.”</p>

<p>A wind passed over the house, and
deep inside the range hood, the damper flapped.</p>

<p>“Julia thinks I don’t believe in
anything,” Jacob said. “Maybe she’s right. I don’t know if this counts as
belief or disbelief, but I’m sure that my grandfather isn’t somewhere other
than in the ground right now. What we’ve got is what we’re going to get. Our
jobs, our marriages…”</p>

<p>“You’re disappointed?”</p>

<p>“I am. Or devastated. No, something
between disappointed and devastated. Dispirited?”</p>

<p>The stubborn recessed light over
the sink went dark with a snapping sound. Some connection wasn’t quite secure.</p>

<p>“It was a hard day,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“Yes, but the day has been
decades.”</p>

<p>“Even though it only felt like a
few seconds?”</p>

<p>“Whenever someone asks me how I’m
doing, I find myself saying, ‘I’m going through a passage.’ Everything is a
transition, turbulence on the way to the destination. But I’ve been saying it
for so long I should probably accept that the rest of my life is going to be
one long passage: an hourglass with no bulbs. Always the pinch.”</p>

<p>“Jacob, you really don’t have
enough problems.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got enough,” Jacob said while
texting Julia again, “believe me. But my problems are so small, so domestic. My
kids stare at screens all day. My dog is incontinent. I have an insatiable
appetite for porn, but can’t count on an erection when there’s an analog pussy
in front of me. I’m balding—which I know you’ve noticed, and thank you for not
drawing attention to it.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t balding.”</p>

<p>“I’m smaller than life.”</p>

<p>Tamir nodded his head and asked,
“Who isn’t smaller than life?”</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“What’s so big about me? I can’t
wait to hear.”</p>

<p>“You’ve fought in wars, and live in
the shadow of future wars, and Christ, Noam is in the middle of who-knows-what
right now. The stakes of your life reflect the size of life.”</p>

<p>“And that’s worth envying?” Tamir
asked. “One less beer and I’d be offended by what you just said.” He drank down
half the bottle. “One more and I’d be furious.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason to be offended.
I’m just saying you’ve escaped the Great Flatness.”</p>

<p>“You think I want anything more
than a boring white house in a boring neighborhood where no one knows each
other because everyone’s watching TV?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jacob said. “I think you’d
go as crazy as my grandfather.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t crazy. You’re the one
who’s crazy.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean—”</p>

<p>The light snapped back on, saving
Jacob from having to know what he meant.</p>

<p>“Listen to yourself, Jacob. You
think it’s all a game, because you’re only a fan.”</p>

<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>

<p>“Worse than a fan. You don’t even
know who you’re rooting for.”</p>

<p>“Hey. Tamir. You’re running with
something I didn’t say. What’s going on?”</p>

<p>Tamir pointed at the
television—Israeli troops holding back an agitated crowd of Palestinians trying
to get into West Jerusalem—and said, “That’s what’s going on. Maybe you haven’t
noticed?”</p>

<p>“But that’s exactly what I’m
talking about.”</p>

<p>“The drama. Right. You love the
drama. It’s who we are that embarrasses you.”</p>

<p>“What? Who does?”</p>

<p>“Israel.”</p>

<p>“Tamir, stop. I don’t know what
you’re talking about, or why this conversation took this turn. Can’t I just
bemoan my life?”</p>

<p>“If I can just defend my own.”</p>

<p>With the hope that a bit of
empowerment might bring Max out of his funk, Jacob and Julia had started to let
him take neighborhood adventures on his own: to the pizza parlor, library,
bakery. One afternoon he came back with a pair of cardboard X-ray glasses from
the drugstore. Jacob covertly watched him try them on, then read the packaging
again, then try them on again, then read the packaging. He wore them around the
first floor, becoming increasingly agitated. “These completely suck!” he said,
throwing them to the floor. Jacob delicately explained that they were a gag,
intended to make other people think you could see through things. “Why wouldn’t
they make that clear on the packaging?” Max asked, his anger upshifting to
humiliation. “And why would it be any less funny if they actually could see
through things?”</p>

<p>What was going on inside Tamir?
Jacob couldn’t understand how the warm banter about happiness had downshifted
to a heated political argument with only one participant. Something had been
touched, but what?</p>

<p>“I work a lot,” Tamir said. “You
know that. I’ve always worked a lot. Some men work to get away from their
families. I work to provide for mine. You believe me when I say that, right?”</p>

<p>Jacob nodded, unable to bring
himself to say, “Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“I missed a lot of dinners when
Noam was young. But I took him to school every morning. It was important to me.
I got to know a lot of the other parents that way. For the most part, I liked
them. But there was one father I couldn’t stand—a real asshole, like me. And so
naturally I hated his child as well. Eitan was his name. So maybe you know
where this story is going?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea, actually.”</p>

<p>“When Noam entered the army, who
should be in his unit?”</p>

<p>“Eitan.”</p>

<p>“Eitan. His father and I exchange
e-mails when one of us has some small bit of news to share. We never spend time
together, and never even talk on the phone. But we write back and forth quite a
bit. I didn’t grow to like him—the more I deal with him, the more I hate him.
But I love him.” He wrapped his hand around the empty bottle. “Can I ask you a
question?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“How much money do you give to
Israel?”</p>

<p>“How much money?” Jacob asked,
going to the fridge to get Tamir another beer, and because he needed to move.
“That’s a funny question.”</p>

<p>“Yes. What do you give to Israel?
I’m serious.”</p>

<p>“What, to the UJA? Ben-Gurion
University?”</p>

<p>“Sure, include it all. And include
your trips to Israel, with your parents, with your own family.”</p>

<p>“You know I haven’t been there with
Julia and the boys.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, you went to Berlin.
Well, imagine you had gone to Israel. Imagine the hotels you would have stayed
in, the cab rides, falafel, the Jerusalem-stone mezuzot you would have brought
back.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re getting
at.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know that I give more than
sixty percent of my salary.”</p>

<p>“You mean in taxes? You live
there.”</p>

<p>“Which is all the more reason you
should have to bear the financial burden.”</p>

<p>“I really can’t follow this
conversation, Tamir.”</p>

<p>“And it’s not only that you refuse
to give your fair share, you take.”</p>

<p>“Take what?”</p>

<p>“Our future. Did you know that more
than forty percent of Israelis are considering emigrating? There was a survey.”</p>

<p>“That’s somehow my fault? Tamir, I
understand that Israel isn’t a college town, and it must be torture to be away
from your family right now, but you’re going after the wrong guy.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You’re complaining about how
fucking dispirited you are, about how small your life is.” Tamir leaned forward.
“I’m scared.”</p>

<p>Jacob was moved to speechlessness.
It was as if he had entered the kitchen that night with cardboard X-ray glasses
and thrown them to the ground in frustration, and instead of explaining that
they were only intended to make others think you could see through things,
Tamir made himself transparent.</p>

<p>“I’m scared,” he said again. “And
I’m sick of bonding with Eitan’s dad.”</p>

<p>“You have more than Eitan’s dad.”</p>

<p>“That’s right: we have the Arabs.”</p>

<p>“Us.”</p>

<p>“Us? Your children are asleep on
organic mattresses. My son is in the middle of that,” he said, pointing at the
television again. “I give more than half of everything I have, and you give one
percent, tops. You want to be part of the epic, and you feel entitled to tell
me how to run my house, and yet you give and do nothing. Give more or talk
less. But no more referring to us.”</p>

<p>Like Jacob, Tamir preferred not to
keep his phone in his pocket and would rest it on tables or counters. Several
times, despite it looking nothing like Jacob’s phone, Jacob instinctively
picked it up. The first time, the home screen was a photo of Noam as a child,
lining up a corner kick. The next time, it was a different photo: Noam in his
uniform, saluting. The next time: Noam in Rivka’s arms.</p>

<p>“I understand that you’re worried,”
Jacob said. “I’d be losing my mind. And if I were you, I’d probably resent me,
too. It’s been a long day.”</p>

<p>“Remember how you were obsessed
with our bomb shelter? When you first visited? Your father, too. I practically
had to drag you out of there.”</p>

<p>“That’s not true.”</p>

<p>“When we defeated half a dozen Arab
armies in ’48—”</p>

<p>“We? You weren’t even born.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, I shouldn’t have
said we. It includes you, and you had nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“I had as much to do with it as you
did.”</p>

<p>“Except that my grandfather risked
his life, and therefore risked my life.”</p>

<p>“He had no choice.”</p>

<p>“America has always been a choice
for us. Just as Israel has for you. Every year you end your seder with ‘Next
year in Jerusalem,’ and every year you choose to celebrate your seder in America.”</p>

<p>“That’s because Jerusalem is an
idea.”</p>

<p>Tamir laughed and banged the table.
“Not for the people who live there, it isn’t. Not when you’re putting a gas
mask on your child. What did your father do in ’73, when the Egyptians and
Syrians were pushing us toward the sea?”</p>

<p>“He wrote op-eds, led marches,
lobbied.”</p>

<p>“You know I love your father, but I
hope you can hear yourself, Jacob. Op-eds? My father commanded a tank unit.”</p>

<p>“My father helped.”</p>

<p>“He gave what he could give without
sacrificing, or even risking, anything. Do you think he considered getting on a
plane and coming to fight?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t know how to fight.”</p>

<p>“It’s not very hard, you just try
not to die. In ’48 they gave rifles to skeletons as they got off their boats
from Europe.”</p>

<p>“And he had a wife at home.”</p>

<p>“No kidding.”</p>

<p>“And it wasn’t his country.”</p>

<p>“Bingo.”</p>

<p>“America was his country.”</p>

<p>“No, he was homelandless.”</p>

<p>“America was his home.”</p>

<p>“America was where he rented a
room. And do you know what would have happened if we’d lost that war, as so
many, and so many of us, feared would happen?”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t lose.”</p>

<p>“But if we had? If we had been
pushed into the sea, or just slaughtered where we were?”</p>

<p>“What’s your point?”</p>

<p>“Your father would have written
op-eds.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure what you’re getting
at with this mental exercise. You’re trying to demonstrate that you live in
Israel and I don’t?”</p>

<p>“No, that Israel is dispensable to
you.”</p>

<p>“Dispensable?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You love it, support it, sing
about it, pray for it, even envy the Jews who live there. And you will survive
without it.”</p>

<p>“In the sense that I wouldn’t stop
breathing?”</p>

<p>“In that sense.”</p>

<p>“Well, in that sense, America is
dispensable to me, as well.”</p>

<p>“That’s absolutely right. People
think the Palestinians are homelandless, but they would die for their homeland.
It’s you who deserves pity.”</p>

<p>“Because I won’t die for a
country?”</p>

<p>“You’re right. I’ve said too
little. You won’t die for anything. I’m sorry if that hurts your feelings, but
don’t pretend it’s unfair or untrue. Julia was right: you don’t believe in
anything.”</p>

<p>It would have been the moment for
one or both of them to storm off, but Jacob took his phone from the table and
calmly said, “I’m gonna take a piss. And when I come back, we’re going to
pretend the last ten minutes didn’t happen.” Tamir showed nothing.</p>

<p>Jacob closed himself in the bathroom,
but he didn’t pee, and he didn’t pretend the fight hadn’t happened. He took his
phone from his pocket. The home screen was a photo taken on Max’s sixth
birthday. He and Julia had given Max a suitcase filled with costumes. A clown
costume. A fireman costume. An Indian. A bellboy. A sheriff. The first one he
tried on, commemorated digitally, was the soldier costume. Jacob flushed
nothing down the toilet, went into his phone’s settings, and replaced the photo
with one of the stock generic images: a treeless leaf.</p>

<p>He went back to the kitchen and
took his seat across from Tamir. He’d decided to try the joke about the
difference between a Subaru and an erection, but before he could get the first
word out, Tamir said, “I don’t know where Noam is.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He was home for a few days. We
exchanged some e-mails, and talked. But he was deployed this afternoon. Rivka
doesn’t know to where. And I haven’t heard anything. He tried calling, but I
stupidly didn’t have my phone on. What kind of father am I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tamir. I’m so sorry. I can’t
even imagine what you’re feeling.”</p>

<p>“You can.”</p>

<p>“Noam will be OK.”</p>

<p>“You can promise me that?”</p>

<p>Jacob scratched at no itch on his
arm and said, “I wish I could.”</p>

<p>“I believed a lot of what I said.
But a lot of it I didn’t believe. Or I’m not sure I believe.”</p>

<p>“I also said some things I didn’t
believe. It happens.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t he send even a
one-sentence e-mail? Two letters: O-K.”</p>

<p>Jacob said, “I don’t know where
Julia is,” trying to meet Tamir’s realness with his own. “She’s not on a work
trip.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No. And I’m scared.”</p>

<p>“Then we can talk.”</p>

<p>“What have we been doing?”</p>

<p>“Making sounds.”</p>

<p>“It’s all my fault. Julia. The
family. I acted as if my home were dispensable.”</p>

<p>“Slow down. Tell me what—”</p>

<p>“She found a phone,” Jacob said, as
if that statement needed something to interrupt in order to be spoken. “A
secret phone of mine.”</p>

<p>“Shit. Why did you have a secret
phone?”</p>

<p>“It was really stupid.”</p>

<p>“You had an affair?”</p>

<p>“I don’t even know what that word
means.”</p>

<p>“You would know if it were Julia
having an affair.” Which released the emergency brake of Jacob’s mind: Was she
having sex with Mark at that moment? Was he fucking her while they talked about
her? Tamir asked, “Did you fuck her?”</p>

<p>Jacob paused, as if he needed to
consider the question, as if he didn’t even know what the word fuck meant.</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“More than once?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Not in the house.”</p>

<p>“No,” Jacob said, as if offended by
the suggestion. “In hotels. Once in the office. It was just permission to
acknowledge our unhappiness. Julia was probably even grateful that it
happened.”</p>

<p>“Everyone is so grateful for the
permission that no one wants.”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same conversation we were
just having. The same.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was revealed to be
bullshit?”</p>

<p>“Some, yes, but not this part: you
can’t say, ‘This is who I am.’ You can’t say, ‘I’m a married man. I have three
great kids, a nice house, a good job. I don’t have everything I want, I’m not
as respected as I might wish, I’m not as rich or loved or fucked as I might
wish, but this is who I am, and choose to be, and admit to being.’ You can’t
say that. But neither can you admit to needing more, to wanting more. Forget
about other people, you can’t even admit your unhappiness to yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’m unhappy. If that’s what you
need to hear me say, there it is. I want more.”</p>

<p>“That’s just making sounds.”</p>

<p>“What isn’t making sounds?”</p>

<p>“Going to Israel. To live.”</p>

<p>“OK, now you’re kidding.”</p>

<p>“I’m saying what you already know.”</p>

<p>“That if I moved to Israel my
marriage would improve?”</p>

<p>“That if you were capable of
standing up and saying, ‘This is who I am,’ you’d at least be living your own
life. Even if who you are is ugly to others. Even if who you are is ugly to
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not living my own life?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Whose life am I living?”</p>

<p>“Maybe your grandfather’s idea of
your life. Or your father’s. Or your own idea. Maybe no life at all.”</p>

<p>Jacob suspected he should take
offense, and he had the instinct to strike back at Tamir, but he also felt
humbled, and grateful.</p>

<p>“It was a long day,” he said, “and
I don’t know that either of us is saying what he means anymore. I like having
you here. It reminds me of when we were kids. Let’s cut our losses.”</p>

<p>Tamir took the last third of his
beer down in one gulp. He placed the bottle back on the table, more gently than
Jacob had seen him do anything, and said, “When do we stop cutting our losses?”</p>

<p>“You and I?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“As opposed to what? Losing it
all?”</p>

<p>“Or reclaiming what’s ours.”</p>

<p>“Yours and mine?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>He finished Jacob’s unfinished beer
and tossed the two empty bottles in the garbage.</p>

<p>“We recycle,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“You have enough towels upstairs?”</p>

<p>“What do you think I do with
towels?”</p>

<p>“Just trying to be a good host.”</p>

<p>“Always trying to be something.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m always trying to be
something. That says something good about me.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“And you’re always trying to be
something, too. And so is Barak. And Julia and Sam and Max and Benjy.
Everybody.”</p>

<p>“What am I trying to be?”</p>

<p>Jacob paused for a beat, careful.</p>

<p>“You’re trying to be bigger than
you actually are.”</p>

<p>Tamir’s smile revealed the force of
the blow.</p>

<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>“Everybody is trying to be
something.”</p>

<p>“Your grandfather isn’t.”</p>

<p>What was that? A stupid joke? Some
kind of lazy stab at wisdom?</p>

<p>“He stopped trying,” Jacob said,
“and it killed him.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong. He’s the only one of
us who actually succeeded.”</p>

<p>“At what?”</p>

<p>“At becoming something.”</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>“Real.”</p>

<p>Jacob almost said, Now you’ve lost
me.</p>

<p>He almost said, I’m heading up.</p>

<p>He almost said, I don’t agree with
anything you’ve said, but I understand you.</p>

<p>The night could end, the
conversation could close, what was shared could be processed, digested, and
expelled, save for the nutrients.</p>

<p>But instead, Jacob asked, “You want
another beer? Or is that just going to get us drunk and fat?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have whatever you’re having,”
Tamir said. “Including drunkenness and fatness.”</p>

<p>“And baldness.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re taking care of that for
both of us.”</p>

<p>“You know,” Jacob said, “I have a
bag of pot upstairs. Somewhere. It’s probably as old as Max, but pot never goes
bad, does it?”</p>

<p>“Not any more than kids do,” Tamir
said.</p>

<p>“Shit.”</p>

<p>“What’s the worst that could
happen? We don’t get high?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>IN THE HINGE</h2>

<p>It took Julia three hours to walk
to Mark’s apartment. Jacob texted and called and texted and called, but she
didn’t text or call ahead to see if Mark was there. Her finger was releasing
the buzzer to his apartment as it was pressing it—the circuit completed for a
startling instant, like a bird hitting a window.</p>

<p>“Hello?”</p>

<p>She stood motionless and silent.
Could the microphone detect her breathing? Was Mark listening to her
exhalations, four floors above?</p>

<p>“I can see you, Julia. There’s a
little camera just above the buzzers.”</p>

<p>“It’s Julia,” Julia said, as if she
could snip out those last couple of seconds and respond to “Hello?” like a
normal human being.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m looking at you.”</p>

<p>“This is an unpleasant feeling.”</p>

<p>“So get out of the frame and come
on up.”</p>

<p>The door opened itself.</p>

<p>And then the elevator doors opened
for her, and then opened for her again.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t expecting you,” Mark
said, ushering her in.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t expecting me, either.”</p>

<p>Reflexively, she scanned the
apartment. Everything was new and new-looking: phony moldings, floors glossy
enough for bowling, fat plastic dimmer slides.</p>

<p>“As you can see,” Mark said, “it’s
a work in progress.”</p>

<p>“What isn’t?”</p>

<p>“A lot of furniture is arriving
tomorrow. Tomorrow it will look completely different.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I’m glad I got to see
the before.”</p>

<p>“And it’s temporary. I needed a
place, and this … was a place.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m judging you?”</p>

<p>“No, but I think you’re judging my
apartment.”</p>

<p>She looked at Mark, the efforts he
made: he worked out, used hair product, bought clothes that someone—in a
magazine or store—told him were cool. She looked around the apartment: how high
were the ceilings, how tall the windows, how glossy the appliances.</p>

<p>“Where do you eat?”</p>

<p>“Out, usually. Always.”</p>

<p>“Where do you open mail?”</p>

<p>“That sofa is where I do
everything.”</p>

<p>“You sleep on it?”</p>

<p>“Everything but sleep.”</p>

<p>Everything but sleep: it was
unbearably suggestive. Or so Julia felt. But everything felt unbearably
suggestive to her right then, because she was unbearably exposed. Before the
skin regrew and healed, some of the inside of Sam’s hand was on the outside,
and infection was a constant concern. Childishly, Julia didn’t want to blame
her child’s hand for its vulnerability, and so saw him as having stayed the
same and the world as having become more threatening. They went straight from
the hospital to ice cream. “Every topping?” the server asked. As her hand
pressed on the door—the first door she’d opened since the heavy one shut—Julia
noticed the back of the OPEN sign. “Look,” she said, finding, in the joke,
another reason to hate herself, “the world is closed.”</p>

<p>“No,” Sam said. “Close. Like near.”</p>

<p>Another reason to hate herself.</p>

<p>There were so many things she could
have said to Mark. There was so much available small talk. It was at sleepaway
camp that she learned how to make a bed with hospital corners. It was at the
hospital that she learned how to press tightly folded words between massive
seconds. But she didn’t want things to be tidy or concealed right then. But she
didn’t want things to be as disheveled and exposed as they felt.</p>

<p>What did she want?</p>

<p>“What do I want?” she asked, quiet
as a spacewalk.</p>

<p>She wanted some of her insides on
the outside, but which insides and how much?</p>

<p>“What?” Mark asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I’m asking you.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear what you asked,” he
said, closing the distance between them, perhaps to hear better.</p>

<p>She’d tried everything: juice
cleanses, poetry binges, knitting, writing letters by hand to people she’d let
go of, moments of the unmediated honesty they’d promised each other in
Pennsylvania sixteen years before. She’d tried meditating half a dozen times,
but always felt lost when guided to “remember” her body. She knew what was
meant, but was incapable, or unwilling.</p>

<p>She took a step toward Mark,
closing the distance, perhaps so that all she couldn’t say could be better
heard.</p>

<p>But now, and without trying, she
remembered her body. She remembered her breasts, which hadn’t been seen by
another man, not sexually, since she was young. She remembered their heaviness,
that they were the slowly descending weights powering her biological clock.
They had appeared too early, but grew too slowly, and were referred to by the
only college boyfriend whose birthday she still remembered as “Platonic.” They
became so sensitive when she had her period that she held them as she walked
around the house. Years after it was turned off for the last time, she still
occasionally heard the asthmatic Medela breast pump struggling not to die. She
had grown to know her breasts more intimately as there was more to fear, but
she looked away when, each of the last three years, they were pressed between
mammogram plates—each time the tech made the unsolicited promise that the
machine delivered less radiation than she would be exposed to on a transatlantic
flight. When Jacob took her to Paris for her forty-first birthday, she imagined
the kids searching the sky for her plane, her breasts glowing like poisoned
beacons for them.</p>

<p>What did she want?</p>

<p>She wanted everything on the
outside.</p>

<p>She wanted something impossible,
whose fulfillment would destroy her.</p>

<p>And then she understood Jacob. She
had believed him when he said his words were only words, but she never
understood him. Now she understood: he needed to stick his hand in the hinge.
But he didn’t want to close the door on himself.</p>

<p>“I need to go home,” she said.</p>

<p>She needed something impossible,
whose fulfillment would save her.</p>

<p>“That’s what you came here to tell
me?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He stood straight, now taller than
he had been. “I get it that you’re on some sort of journey,” he said. “Nobody
gets that better than I do. And I’m really glad to have served as a rest stop
where you could stretch your legs, get some gas, and pee.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t be mad,” she said,
almost like a girl.</p>

<p>Her skin was burning with fear—of
his anger, of deserving it, of being, finally, justly punished for her badness.
She could be forgiven for allowing her children to be hurt, but there is no
punishment great enough for hurting one’s children knowingly. She was going to
destroy her family—on purpose, and not because there were no alternatives. She
was going to choose not to have a choice.</p>

<p>“I hope I facilitated a lot of
growth,” Mark went on, now making no effort to contain his hurt. “I do. I hope
you learned something with me that you can apply later with someone else. But
if I can offer a little free advice?”</p>

<p>“I just need to go home,” she said,
terrified of what he would say next, that by some magical justice it would kill
her children.</p>

<p>“You’re not the problem, Julia.
Your life is the problem.”</p>

<p>Kindness was worse than what she’d
been most afraid of.</p>

<p>He opened the door. “And I say this
wishing only for peace for both of us: know that next time I see your face on
the screen, I’m not even going to watch you wait.”</p>

<p>“I need to go home,” she said.</p>

<p>“Good luck with that,” he said.</p>

<p>She left.</p>

<p>She took a cab to a hotel whose
renovation she’d nearly been hired to oversee.</p>

<p>There was a cartoonishly large,
unnaturally symmetrical floral arrangement centered under ten thousand
chandelier crystals.</p>

<p>And a bellhop said something into a
palmed microphone whose cord ran up his sleeve and down his side to a
transmitter clipped to his belt—there had to be a better way to communicate.</p>

<p>And the desk clerk, who could
almost have been Sam in fifteen years, but with a perfect left hand, asked,
“How many keys will you be needing?”</p>

<p>She thought of saying, “All of
them.” She thought of saying, “None.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>WHO’S IN THE UNOCCUPIED ROOM?</h2>

<p>By the time Jacob came back
downstairs with the pot, Tamir had already turned an apple into a pipe,
seemingly without tools.</p>

<p>“Impressive,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“I am an impressive person.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can certainly turn a
piece of fruit into drug paraphernalia.”</p>

<p>“Still smells like pot,” Tamir
said, opening the innermost bag. “That’s a good sign.”</p>

<p>They cracked some windows and
smoked in a silence broken only by Jacob’s humiliating coughing. They sat back.
They waited.</p>

<p>Somehow the station had changed to
ESPN. Had the television achieved sentience and will? There was a documentary
about the 1988 trade that sent Wayne Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers to the
L.A. Kings—the effects it had on Gretzky, Edmonton, L.A., the sport of hockey,
planet Earth, and the universe. What at any other time would have compelled
Jacob to either smash his TV or blind himself was suddenly the happiest
reprieve. Had Tamir put it on?</p>

<p>They lost track of how much time
passed—it could have been forty-five seconds or forty-five minutes. It mattered
as little to them as it did to Isaac.</p>

<p>“I feel good,” Jacob said, leaning
as he’d been told to do at the Passover seders of his childhood, as befits a
free man.</p>

<p>“I feel very good,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“Just basically, fundamentally …
good.”</p>

<p>“I know the feeling.”</p>

<p>“But the thing is, my life isn’t
good.”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, you know? Yeah, yours isn’t,
either?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Childhood is good,” Jacob said,
“the rest is pushing things around. If you’re lucky, you give a shit about the
things. But it’s different only by degrees.”</p>

<p>“But those degrees matter.”</p>

<p>“Do they?”</p>

<p>“If one thing matters, everything
matters.”</p>

<p>“That is a seriously good
impersonation of wisdom.”</p>

<p>“Lo mein matters. Stupid, dirty
jokes matter. Firm mattresses and soft sheets matter. The Boss matters.”</p>

<p>“The Boss?”</p>

<p>“Springsteen. A heated toilet seat
matters. The small things: changing a lightbulb, losing to your child at
basketball, driving nowhere. There’s your Great Flatness. And I could go on.”</p>

<p>“Better still, do you think you
could go back to the beginning and do that, exactly that, again, and I’ll
record it?”</p>

<p>“Chinese food matters. Stupid,
dirty jokes matter. Firm mattresses and soft sheets—”</p>

<p>“I’m high.”</p>

<p>“I’m looking at the chandelier from
above.”</p>

<p>“Is it dusty?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“Another person would ask if it was
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“People shouldn’t be allowed to get
married until it’s too late to have kids.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you could get enough
signatures to make that happen.”</p>

<p>“And having a gratifying career is
impossible.”</p>

<p>“For anyone?”</p>

<p>“For good fathers. But it’s so hard
to deviate. All these fucking Jewish nails driven through my palms.”</p>

<p>“Jewish nails?”</p>

<p>“Expectations. Prescriptions.
Commandments. Wanting to please everyone. And the rest of them.”</p>

<p>“Them?”</p>

<p>“Did you ever have to read that
poem, or journal entry, or whatever, by the kid who died in Auschwitz? Or maybe
Treblinka? Not really the important detail, I just … The one about ‘Next time
you throw a ball, throw it for me’?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Consider yourself lucky. Anyway, I
might not be getting it exactly right, but the gist is: don’t mourn for me,
live for me. I’m about to get gassed, so do me a favor and have fun.”</p>

<p>“Never heard it.”</p>

<p>“I must have heard it a thousand
times. It was the theme song of my Jewish education, and it ruined everything.
Not because every time you throw a ball you’re thinking of the corpse of a kid
who should have been you, but because sometimes you just want to veg out in
front of shitty TV, and instead you think, ‘I should really go throw a ball.’”</p>

<p>Tamir laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s funny, except that throwing a
ball becomes an attitude toward academic achievement, becomes measuring the
distance from perfection in units of failure, becomes going to a college that
murdered kid would have killed to go to, becomes studying things you aren’t
interested in but are good and worthy and remunerative, becomes getting married
Jewishly and having Jewish kids and living Jewishly in some demented effort to
redeem the suffering that made your increasingly alienating life possible.”</p>

<p>“You should smoke a bit more.”</p>

<p>“The problem is,” Jacob said,
taking back the apple, “the fulfillment of the expectations feels amazing, but
you only fulfill them once—‘I got an A!’ ‘I’m getting married!’ ‘It’s a
boy!’—and then you’re left to experience them. Nobody knows it at the time, and
everybody knows it later, but nobody admits it, because it would pull a
foundational log from the Jewish tower of Jenga. You trade emotional ambition
for companionship, a life of inhabiting a nerve-filled body for companionship,
exploration for companionship. There’s a good in commitment, I know. Things
have to grow over time, mature, become full. But there’s a price, and just
because we don’t talk about it doesn’t mean it’s endurable. So many blessings,
but did anyone ever stop to ask why one would want a blessing?”</p>

<p>“Blessings are just curses that
other people envy.”</p>

<p>“You should smoke more pot, Tamir.
It turns you into fucking Yoda, or at least Deepak Chopra.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it allows you to listen
differently.”</p>

<p>“You see! That’s exactly what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“You’re becoming funny,” Tamir
said, bringing the apple to his mouth.</p>

<p>“I was always funny.”</p>

<p>“So maybe I’m the one listening
differently.”</p>

<p>Tamir took another hit.</p>

<p>“What was Julia’s reaction? To the
texts?”</p>

<p>“Not good. Obviously.”</p>

<p>“You’ll stay together?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Of course. We have the kids.
And we’ve had a life together.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

<p>“I mean, we’ve talked about
separating.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’re right.”</p>

<p>Jacob took another hit.</p>

<p>“Have I ever told you about my TV
show?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean my TV show.”</p>

<p>“I’m high, Jacob. Pretend I’m a
six-year-old.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been writing a show about
us.”</p>

<p>“You and me?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not you. Or not yet.”</p>

<p>“I’d be great in a TV show.”</p>

<p>“My family.”</p>

<p>“I’m in your family.”</p>

<p>“My family here. Isaac. My parents.
Julia and the kids.”</p>

<p>“Who would want to watch that?”</p>

<p>“Everybody, probably. But that’s
not the point. The point is, it’s probably really good, and probably the
writing I was born to do, and for the last ten or so years I’ve been pretty
singularly devoted to it.”</p>

<p>“Ten years?”</p>

<p>“And I’ve never shared it with
anyone.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, before Isaac died, it was
because I was afraid of betraying him.”</p>

<p>“With?”</p>

<p>“With the truth of who we are, and
what we’re like.”</p>

<p>“How would that be a betrayal?”</p>

<p>“I was listening to the radio the
other morning, a science podcast I like. They were interviewing a woman who’d
lived in that massive geodesic dome for two years—nothing goes in, nothing goes
out. That one. It was pretty interesting.”</p>

<p>“Let’s listen to it now.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m just searching for a
metaphor.”</p>

<p>“It would make me so happy to
listen to it right now.”</p>

<p>“I can’t even tell if you’re
serious or making fun of me.”</p>

<p>“Please, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“I still can’t tell. But anyway,
she talked about how living in that closed environment made her aware of the
interconnectedness of life: this thing eats this thing, then poops, which feeds
this thing, which blah blah blah. Then she went on to talk about something I
already knew—not because I’m so fucking smart, but because it’s just one of
those things that most people know—that with every inhalation, you are likely
breathing in molecules that were breathed out by Pol Pot, or Caesar, or even
the dinosaurs. I could be wrong about that dinosaur bit. I’ve found myself
really interested in dinosaurs recently. I don’t know why. I spent about thirty
years not thinking about them at all, and then suddenly I was interested again.
I heard, in another podcast—”</p>

<p>“You listen to a lot of podcasts.”</p>

<p>“I know. I really do. It’s
embarrassing, right?”</p>

<p>“You’re asking me if you’re
embarrassed?”</p>

<p>“It’s humiliating.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why.”</p>

<p>“What kind of person sneaks off to
unoccupied rooms and presses an almost-muted phone to his ear so that he, and
only he, will hear a putterer’s exploration of something as irrelevant as
echolocation. It’s humiliating. And the humiliation is humiliating.” With his
beer bottle, Jacob drew a ring of condensation on the table. “Anyway, this
other podcast did this whole thing about how all the dinosaurs—not just most of
them, but all of them—were destroyed at once. They roamed the earth for some
large number of millions of years, and then, in something like an hour, gone.
Why do people always use the word roam when referring to dinosaurs?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“They do, though. Dinosaurs roamed
the earth. It’s weird.”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“So weird, right?”</p>

<p>“The more I think about it, the
weirder it becomes.”</p>

<p>“Jews roamed Europe for thousands
of years…”</p>

<p>“And then, in something like a
decade…”</p>

<p>“But I was saying something else.
About the dome woman … dinosaurs … maybe Pol Pot?”</p>

<p>“Breathing.”</p>

<p>“Right! With each inhalation we
take in molecules yada yada. Anyway, my eyes started to roll, because it just
sounded like trite cocktail science shit. But then she went further, to say
that our exhalations are just as certainly going to be inhaled by our great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren.”</p>

<p>“And future dinosaurs.”</p>

<p>“And future Pol Pots.”</p>

<p>They laughed.</p>

<p>“But it really upset me, for some
reason. I didn’t start crying or anything. I didn’t have to pull over. But I
did have to turn off the podcast. It suddenly became too much.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think?”</p>

<p>“Why do I think at all?”</p>

<p>“No. Why do you think it upset you
to imagine your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren
breathing your breath?”</p>

<p>Jacob released a breath that would
be inhaled by the last of his line.</p>

<p>“Try,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“I guess”—another breath—“I guess I
was raised to understand that I’m not worthy of all that came before me. But no
one ever prepared me for the knowledge that I’m not worthy of all that will
come after me, either.”</p>

<p>Tamir lifted the apple from the
table, held it so that the chandelier light passed straight through its cored
center, and said, “I want to fuck this apple.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“But my cock is too big,” he said.
And then, trying to push his hairy-knuckled forefinger into it: “I can’t even
finger-fuck it.”</p>

<p>“Put the apple down, Tamir.”</p>

<p>“It’s the Apple of Truth,” Tamir
said, ignoring Jacob. “And I want to fuck it.”</p>

<p>“Jesus.”</p>

<p>“I’m serious.”</p>

<p>“You want to fuck the Apple of
Truth, but your cock is too big?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is exactly the
predicament.”</p>

<p>“The present predicament? Or the
predicament of life?”</p>

<p>“Both.”</p>

<p>“You’re high.”</p>

<p>“So are you.”</p>

<p>“The scientist who was talking
about the dinosaurs—”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“That podcast. The scientist said
something so beautiful I thought I would die.”</p>

<p>“Don’t die.”</p>

<p>“He asked the listener to imagine a
bullet being fired through water, and how it would leave a conical wake of
emptiness behind it—a hole in the water—before the water had time to come back
together. He said that an asteroid would create a similar wake—a rip in the
atmosphere—and that a dinosaur looking at the asteroid would see a nighttime
hole in a daytime sky. That’s what he would see just before being destroyed.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s not that you wanted to
die, but that you became like the dinosaur.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“It saw something incredibly
beautiful before it was destroyed. You heard about it, and thought it was
incredibly beautiful, and so assumed you would be destroyed.”</p>

<p>“They give MacArthurs to all the
wrong people.”</p>

<p>“I lied.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“Most things.”</p>

<p>“OK?”</p>

<p>“Rivka and I have been talking
about moving.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Talking.”</p>

<p>“Moving where?”</p>

<p>“You’re going to make me say it?”</p>

<p>“I guess I am.”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>“You’re kidding me.”</p>

<p>“Just talking. Just thinking about
it. I get job offers every now and then, and a month ago I got a really good
one, a great one, with a tech firm. Rivka and I were playing make-believe at
the dinner table, imagining what it would be like if I took the job, and then
the conversation stopped being make-believe.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were happy there?
And all that shit about renting a room in America?”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything I said
before?”</p>

<p>“When you were begging me to make
aliyah?”</p>

<p>“So I can make hayila.”</p>

<p>“Which is what?”</p>

<p>“Aliyah backward.”</p>

<p>“You just did that in your head?”</p>

<p>“While you were talking.”</p>

<p>“And what, there’s some sort of
Bloch-Blumenberg Constant that has to be maintained?”</p>

<p>“A Jew Constant. Ideally, American
Jews and Israeli Jews would just switch places.”</p>

<p>“Is this what we were talking about
the whole time? Your guilt about leaving Israel?”</p>

<p>“No, we were talking about your
guilt about leaving your marriage.”</p>

<p>“I’m not leaving my marriage,”
Jacob said.</p>

<p>“And I’m not leaving Israel,” Tamir
said.</p>

<p>“All just talk?”</p>

<p>“Whenever I would turn down an
offer of my father’s—for another piece of halvah, an evening walk—he’d say, ‘De
zelbe prayz.’ Same price. It was the only time he used Yiddish. He hated
Yiddish. But he’d say that. And not only in Yiddish, he’d imitate my
grandfather’s voice. It doesn’t cost me anything to talk about leaving Israel.
Same price as not talking about it. I can really hear my father imitating my
grandfather: de zelbe prayz.”</p>

<p>Tamir woke up his phone and showed
Jacob pictures of Noam: from the hospital, first steps, first day of school,
first soccer game, first date, first time in his army uniform. “I’ve been
obsessed with these pictures,” Tamir said. “Not with looking at them, but
seeing that they’re still there. Sometimes I check under the table. Sometimes I
go to the bathroom to do it. Remember going to the supermarket with your kids
when they were small? That feeling that the second they were out of your sight,
they would disappear forever? It’s like that.”</p>

<p>All the dinosaurs were wiped out,
but some mammals survived. Most of them were burrowers. Underground, they were
protected from the heat that consumed every living thing aboveground. Tamir was
burying himself in his phone, in the photos of his son.</p>

<p>“Are we good men?” Tamir asked.</p>

<p>“What a strange question.”</p>

<p>“Is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s any higher
power judging us,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“But how should we judge
ourselves?”</p>

<p>“With tears, with silence, with—?”</p>

<p>“Even my confession was a lie.”</p>

<p>“I must have given you reasons to
lie.”</p>

<p>“I want to leave. Rivka doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“You want to leave Israel? Or you
want to leave your marriage?”</p>

<p>“Israel.”</p>

<p>“Did you have an affair?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did she?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’m always tired,” Jacob said.
“Always exhausted. I’ve never wondered about it before, but what if this whole
time I haven’t been tired at all? What if my tiredness is just a hiding place?”</p>

<p>“There are worse hiding places.”</p>

<p>“And what if I decided that I would
never be tired again? If I simply refused to be tired. My body could be tired,
but not me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Or what if I can’t get out of my
hiding place on my own? If it’s too familiar, too safe? And I need to be smoked
out?”</p>

<p>“I think you’re smoking yourself
out right now.”</p>

<p>“What if I need Julia to smoke me
out?”</p>

<p>Jacob looked at the apple between
them. He understood what Tamir meant, about wanting to fuck it. It wasn’t a
sexual longing, but an existential one—to enter one’s truth.</p>

<p>“You know what I’d like to do right
now?”</p>

<p>“What?” Tamir asked.</p>

<p>“Shave my head.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“So I can see how bald I really am.
And so everyone can see.”</p>

<p>“What if we made some popcorn
instead?”</p>

<p>“It would be awful. But I’m ready
for it. But it would be awful. But I’m ready for it.”</p>

<p>“You keep saying the same thing
over and over.”</p>

<p>“I think I’m falling asleep.”</p>

<p>“So sleep.”</p>

<p>“But…”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’ve also been lying.”</p>

<p>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I just don’t know which
parts.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have an affair.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“Or I did, but I didn’t fuck her.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?”</p>

<p>“Just a bunch of texts. And not
even that many.”</p>

<p>“Why did you lie about it?”</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t want to get
caught.”</p>

<p>“To me.”</p>

<p>“Oh. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“There was a reason.”</p>

<p>“I’m high.”</p>

<p>“But it’s the only thing you lied
about.”</p>

<p>“When Julia found my phone and I
told her the truth—that nothing actually happened—she believed me.”</p>

<p>“That’s good.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t that she trusted me.
She said she knew I wasn’t capable of it.”</p>

<p>“And you wanted me to think you
were capable of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s my interpretation of
myself, yes.”</p>

<p>“Even though you aren’t capable of
it.”</p>

<p>“Affirmative.”</p>

<p>“You asked before, what kind of
person sneaks around to listen to science podcasts?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The kind of person who uses the
same phone to sext a woman he won’t touch.”</p>

<p>“It was a different phone.”</p>

<p>“It was the same hand.”</p>

<p>“So now you’ve shaved my head,”
Jacob said, closing his eyes. “Tell me what I can’t see.”</p>

<p>“You’re balder than I thought, and
less bald than you think.”</p>

<p>Jacob felt the reflexive jerking,
the fall down the elevator shaft that marked the onset of sleep. He couldn’t
account for the passage of time, or movement between thoughts, or stretches
without thought.</p>

<p>What would happen to the sound of
time? If all that he and Julia had rehearsed were performed? If it weren’t the
same price to explore an idea? No more candlelit whispering into the boys’
ears. No more dishwashing musings about that afternoon’s birthday party. No
more scrape of the rake as the leaves were pulled against the curb so they
could be jumped into just one last time. What would he listen for to hear his
life? Or would he be deaf to it?</p>

<p>The next thing he was aware of was
a hand, a voice. “There’s news,” Tamir said, shaking Jacob by the forearm.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You were asleep.”</p>

<p>“No. I wasn’t. I was just
thinking.”</p>

<p>“There’s something big on the
news.”</p>

<p>“Gimme a second.”</p>

<p>Jacob blinked away the glazing,
rolled his head from shoulder to shoulder, and walked to the sofa.</p>

<p>Two hours earlier, while Jacob and
Tamir were getting stoned, some Israeli extremists entered the Dome of the Rock
and set it on fire. The flames caused hardly any damage, the Israelis claimed,
but the effort caused more than enough. The television, which had somehow
switched from ESPN to CNN, showed images of rage: men—always men—punching the
sky, shooting broken rivers of bullets at the sky, trying to kill the sky.
Jacob had seen this before, but the images had always come from the vicinity of
the quake, primarily Gaza and the West Bank. Now, however, CNN was bouncing
from feed to feed, with a seemingly endless supply of fury: a circle of men
burning an Israeli flag in Jakarta; men in Khartoum swinging sticks at an
effigy of the Israeli prime minister; men in Karachi, and Dhaka, and Riyadh,
and Lahore; men with bandanas over their mouths smashing a Jewish storefront in
Paris; a man, whose accent was so thick it’s unlikely he knew one hundred words
of English, screaming, “Death to Jews!” into a camera in Tehran.</p>

<p>“This is bad,” Jacob said,
transfixed and intoxicated by the images.</p>

<p>“Bad?”</p>

<p>“Very bad.”</p>

<p>“I need to go home.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Jacob said, too groggy to
understand, or even to be sure that he wasn’t still asleep. “We’ll figure it
out.”</p>

<p>“Now. We need to go to the
embassy.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. OK.”</p>

<p>Tamir shook his head and said,
“Now, now, now.”</p>

<p>“I get it. Let me put some clothes
on.”</p>

<p>But neither moved from the sofa.
The television filled with Jewish rage: black-hatted men screaming in Hebrew in
London; dark men from one of the last remaining kibbutzim waving fingers at the
camera, hysterically repeating words Jacob didn’t understand; Jewish men
clashing with Jewish soldiers guarding the Temple Mount.</p>

<p>Tamir said, “You need to come,
too.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Give me a minute.”</p>

<p>“No,” Tamir said, grabbing Jacob’s
shoulders with the force he used at the zoo three decades before. “You need to
come home.”</p>

<p>“I am home. What?”</p>

<p>“To Israel.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You need to come to Israel with
me.”</p>

<p>“I do?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Tamir, you want to leave Israel.”</p>

<p>“Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Now you want me to go?”</p>

<p>Tamir pointed at the TV. “Are you
looking at this?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking at that for a
week.”</p>

<p>“No. No one has ever seen this
before.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“This is how it ends,” he said.
“Like this.” And for the first time since Tamir had arrived in D.C., for the
first time ever, Jacob saw the family resemblance. He saw the panicked eyes of
his boys—the terror he looked into before blood tests and after injuries that
drew blood.</p>

<p>“How it ends?”</p>

<p>“How Israel is destroyed.”</p>

<p>“Because Muslims are screaming in
Jakarta and Riyadh? What are they going to do, walk to Jerusalem?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And ride horses, and drive
shitty cars, and be bussed, and take boats. And it’s not only them. Look at
us.”</p>

<p>“It will pass.”</p>

<p>“It won’t. This is how it will all
end.”</p>

<p>Neither the images on the screen
nor Tamir’s words scared Jacob as much as the terror he saw in his children’s
eyes in Tamir’s eyes.</p>

<p>“If you really believe that, Tamir,
you need to get your family out of Israel.”</p>

<p>“I can’t!” he said, and then Jacob
saw, in Tamir’s clenched teeth, Irv’s fury—the deep inner sadness that knew no
expression but directionless rage.</p>

<p>“Why?” Jacob asked. “What could
possibly be more important than your family’s safety?”</p>

<p>“I can’t get them out, Jacob. There
are no flights in or out. Don’t you think I’ve tried? What do you think I do
all day? Go to museums? Go shopping? I’m trying to keep my family safe. I can’t
get them out, so I have to go. And you have to go, too.”</p>

<p>Jacob was now too awake for
nonchalant bravery.</p>

<p>“Israel isn’t my home, Tamir.”</p>

<p>“That’s only because it hasn’t been
destroyed yet.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s because it isn’t my
home.”</p>

<p>“But it’s my home,” he said, and
now Jacob saw Julia. He saw the pleading he hadn’t been able to see when her
home still could have been saved. He saw his own blindness.</p>

<p>“Tamir, you—”</p>

<p>But the words wouldn’t form,
because there was no thought for them to express. It didn’t matter: Tamir had
stopped listening. He was angled away and texting. Rivka? Noam? Jacob didn’t
ask, because he felt it wasn’t his place.</p>

<p>His place was the unoccupied room,
typing: you’re begging me to fuck your tight pussy, but you don’t deserve it
yet.</p>

<p>His place was the unoccupied room,
the same hand pressing a different phone to his ear so that he, and only he,
could hear: “Blind people can see. It’s true. Making clicking sounds in their
mouths, they can orient themselves by the echoes returning from nearby objects.
Doing this, blind people are able to go on hikes in rocky terrain, navigate
city streets, even ride bikes. But is that seeing? Brain scans of people
echolocating show activity in the same visual centers as in the brains of
people with sight; they are simply seeing through their ears, instead of their
eyes.”</p>

<p>His place was the unoccupied room,
reading: my husband is away this weekend with the kids, come fuck me for real.</p>

<p>His place was the unoccupied room,
hearing: “‘So why aren’t more blind people on bikes? According to David
Spellman, the preeminent teacher of echolocation, it’s because few are given
the necessary freedom to learn how.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s the rare parent, maybe one
in a hundred, probably fewer, who is able to watch her blind child approach an
intersection and not grab his arm. It’s with love that they’re holding him back
from danger, but they’re also holding him back from sight. When I teach
children to ride bikes, there are inevitably crashes, just as there are with
sighted children. But parents of blind children almost always take it as proof
that too much is being asked of their child, and they step in to protect him.
The more the parents want their children to see, the less possible they make
it, because that love gets in the way.’</p>

<p>“‘How were you able to overcome
that and learn?’</p>

<p>“‘My father left before I was born,
and my mother had three jobs. The absence of love allowed me to see.’”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>DE ZELBE PRAYZ</h2>

<p>Tamir went upstairs, and Jacob sat
there, trying to replay the last few moments, and the last two hours, and the
last two weeks, and the last thirteen, and sixteen, and forty-two years. What
had happened?</p>

<p>Tamir had said Jacob wouldn’t die
for anything. Even if that were true, why would it matter? What’s so inherently
good about such ultimate devotion? What’s so wrong with making good-enough
money, eating good-enough food, living in a nice-enough house, striving to be
as ethical and ambitious as circumstances allow? He had tried, he had come up
short every single time, but against what measure? He had given his family a
good-enough life. It felt as if an only life should be better than good enough,
but how many efforts for more have ended with having nothing?</p>

<p>Years before, in the time when he
and Julia would still share their work with each other, Julia came to the
basement with a mug of tea in each hand and asked how it was going.</p>

<p>Jacob leaned back in his Aeron and
said, “Well, it’s nowhere near as good as it could be, but I suppose it’s as
good as I can make it right now.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s as good as it could be.”</p>

<p>“No,” Jacob said, “it could be a
lot better.”</p>

<p>“How? If someone else wrote it? If
you wrote it at a different time in your life? We’d be talking about something
else.”</p>

<p>“If I were a better writer.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not,” she said, putting
a mug on his desk, “you’re only perfect.”</p>

<p>For all that he couldn’t give
Julia, he had given her a lot. He wasn’t a great artist, but he worked hard
(enough), and was devoted (enough) to his writing. It is not a weakness to
acknowledge complexity. It is not a retreat to take a step back. He wasn’t
wrong to be envious of those wailing men on prayer mats in the Dome of the
Rock, but maybe he was wrong to see reflected in their devotion his own
existential pallor. Agnosticism is no less devout than fundamentalism, and maybe
he’d destroyed what he loved, blind to the perfection of good-enough.</p>

<p>He called Julia’s cell. She didn’t
answer. It was two in the morning, but there was no time of day, those days,
when she would answer his call.</p>

<p>Hi, you’ve reached Julia …</p>

<p>But she would see that he had
reached for her.</p>

<p>At the beep he said, “It’s me. I
don’t know if you’ve been watching the news, but some extremists set fire to
the Dome of the Rock, or tried to. Jewish extremists. I suppose they succeeded,
technically. It was a very small fire. But, you know, it’s a huge deal. Anyway,
you can watch. Or read about it. I don’t even know where you are. Where are
you? So—”</p>

<p>The voice mail cut him off. He
called again.</p>

<p>Hi, you’ve reached Julia …</p>

<p>“I got cut off. I don’t know how
much got through, but I was saying that the Middle East just blew up, and Tamir
is totally hysterical, and he wants me to take him to the embassy tonight, like
now, at two in the morning, to try to somehow get him on a plane. And the thing
is, he says I need to go with him. And at first I just thought he meant—”</p>

<p>The voice mail cut him off. He
called again.</p>

<p>Hi, you’ve reached Julia …</p>

<p>“And … it’s me. Jacob. Obviously.
Anyway, I was just saying that Tamir is freaking out, and I’m taking him to the
embassy—I’ll wake up Sam and let him know that we’re going out, and that he has
to—”</p>

<p>The voice mail cut him off. The
allowed increments seemed to be shrinking. He called again.</p>

<p>“Jacob?”</p>

<p>“Julia?”</p>

<p>“What time is it?”</p>

<p>“I thought your phone was off.”</p>

<p>“Why are you calling?”</p>

<p>“Well, I basically said it in the
messages, but—”</p>

<p>“What time is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s like two or so.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Jacob, why are you calling me at
two in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s important.”</p>

<p>“Are the kids OK?”</p>

<p>“Yes, everyone’s fine. But Israel—”</p>

<p>“Nothing happened—?”</p>

<p>“No. Not to the kids. They’re
sleeping. It’s Israel.”</p>

<p>“Tell me in the morning, OK?”</p>

<p>“Julia, I wouldn’t call if it
weren’t—”</p>

<p>“If the boys are OK, whatever it is
can wait.”</p>

<p>“It can’t.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, it can. Good night,
Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Some extremists tried to set fire
to the Dome of the Rock.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a war.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“A war against us.”</p>

<p>“We have a ton of batteries in the
fridge.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’m half asleep.”</p>

<p>“I think I’m going to go.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“To Israel. With Tamir.”</p>

<p>He heard her shift, and muffled
static.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to Israel.”</p>

<p>“I’m really thinking about it.”</p>

<p>“You’d never let such a dumb
sentence slip into one of your scripts.”</p>

<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>

<p>“It means let’s talk in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to Israel,” he said, and
this time, removing the I think, expressed something entirely different—a
certainty that when spoken aloud revealed to Jacob his lack of certainty. The
first time he’d wanted to hear her say, “Don’t go.” But instead she didn’t
believe him.</p>

<p>“And why would you do that?”</p>

<p>“To help.”</p>

<p>“What, write for the army paper?”</p>

<p>“Whatever they ask me to do. Fill
sandbags, make sandwiches, fight.”</p>

<p>She laughed herself into a fuller
wakefulness: “Fight?”</p>

<p>“If that’s what’s necessary.”</p>

<p>“And how would that work?”</p>

<p>“They need men.”</p>

<p>She chuckled. Jacob thought he
heard her chuckle.</p>

<p>“I’m not seeking your respect or approval,”
he said. “I’m telling you because we’re going to need to figure out what the
next couple of weeks will look like. I assume you’ll come home and—”</p>

<p>“I respect and approve of your
desire to be a hero, especially right now—”</p>

<p>“What you’re doing sucks.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, her voice now
aggressively clear, “what you’re doing sucks. Waking me up in the middle of the
night with this idiotic Kabuki enactment of … I don’t even know what.
Resolution? Bravery? Selflessness? You assume I’ll come home? That’s nice. And
then what? I’ll single-handedly take care of the kids for however long your
paintball adventure lasts? That shouldn’t be any problem: preparing three meals
a day for them—make that nine meals, as no two will ever eat the same thing—and
chauffeuring to cello lessons, and speech therapy, and soccer, and soccer, and
Hebrew school, and various health professionals? Yeah. I want to be a hero,
too. I think being a hero would be awesome. But first, before we get measured
for capes, let’s see if we can maintain what we already have.”</p>

<p>“Julia—”</p>

<p>“I’m not finished. You woke me up
with this absurd shit, so now I’m entitled to hold the conch. If we were
actually to entertain this utterly ridiculous notion of you in combat for a
moment, then we would have to acknowledge that any army that would include you
among its fighting ranks is desperate, and desperate armies tend not to be in
the business of treating every life as if it were all of humankind, and without
having any military expertise, I’m guessing you’re not going to be called upon
for specialized operations, like bomb defusing or surgical assassinations, but
something more like ‘Stand in front of this bullet so your meat will at least
slow it before it enters the person we actually value.’ And then you’ll be
dead. And your kids will be fatherless. And your father will become a yet more
public asshole. And—”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“What will you become?”</p>

<p>“In sickness and in sickness,”
Jacob’s mother had said at his wedding. “That is what I wish for you. Don’t
seek or expect miracles. There are no miracles. Not anymore. And there are no
cures for the hurt that hurts most. There is only the medicine of believing
each other’s pain, and being present for it.”</p>

<p>Jacob had regained the hearing he’d
pretended to lose as a child, and acquired a kind of pet interest in deafness
that stayed with him into adulthood. He never shared it with Julia or anyone,
as it felt distasteful, wrong. No one, not even Dr. Silvers, knew that he was
able to sign, or that he would attend annual conventions for the D.C. chapter
of the National Association of the Deaf. He didn’t pretend he was deaf when he
went. He pretended he was a teacher at an elementary school for deaf children.
He explained his interest by saying he was the child of a deaf father.</p>

<p>“What will you become, Julia?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea what it is you’re
trying to get me to say. That contemplating having to raise three kids on my
own makes me selfish?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you implying it’s what I
secretly want?”</p>

<p>“Is it? That hadn’t even occurred
to me, but it obviously occurred to you.”</p>

<p>“Are you serious?”</p>

<p>“What will you become?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea what water it is
you’re trying to lead me to, but I’m fucking tired, and tired of this
conversation, so if you have something to say—”</p>

<p>“Why won’t you just tell me you
want me to stay?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand why you can’t
bring yourself to say that you don’t want me to go.”</p>

<p>“It’s what I’ve been saying for the
last five minutes.”</p>

<p>“No, you’ve been saying it’s unfair
to the kids. That it’s unfair to you.”</p>

<p>“Unfair is your word.”</p>

<p>“Not once have you said that
you—you Julia—don’t want me to go because you don’t want me to go.”</p>

<p>She opened a silence as the rabbi
had opened the rip in Irv’s jacket at the funeral.</p>

<p>“A widow,” Jacob said. “That’s what
you’ll become. You’re constantly projecting your needs and fears onto the kids,
or me, or whoever is within reach. Why can’t you just admit that you—you—don’t
want to be a widow?”</p>

<p>He heard, he thought he heard, the
springs of a mattress return to their state of rest. What bed was she rising
from? How much of her body was uncovered, in what degree of darkness?</p>

<p>“Because I wouldn’t be a widow,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, you would.”</p>

<p>“No, Jacob, I wouldn’t. A widow is
someone whose spouse has died.”</p>

<p>“And?”</p>

<p>“And you’re not my spouse.”</p>

<p>In the 1970s there was no
infrastructure to care for deaf children in Nicaragua—no schools, no
educational or informational resources, there wasn’t even a codified sign
language. When the first Nicaraguan school for the deaf was opened, the
teachers taught the lip-reading of Spanish. But on the playground the children
communicated using the signs they had developed in their homes, organically
generating a shared vocabulary and grammar. As generations of students moved
through the school, the improvised language grew and matured. It is the only
documented instance of a language being created entirely from scratch by its
speakers. No adult helped, nothing was recorded on paper, there were no models.
Only the children’s will to be understood.</p>

<p>Jacob and Julia had tried. They had
created signs, and they would spell words in front of the still-young kids, and
there were codes. But the language they had created, and were even then
creating, made the world smaller rather than clearer.</p>

<p>I’m not your spouse.</p>

<p>Because of those texts? Destroy
everything because of the arrangement of a few hundred letters? What did he
think was going to happen? And what did he think he was doing? Julia was right:
it wasn’t a moment of weakness. He pushed the exchange into sexuality, he
bought the second phone, he was forming the words whenever he wasn’t typing
them, stealing off to read hers as soon as they came through. He’d more than
once put Benjy in front of a movie so he could jerk off to a new message. Why?</p>

<p>Because it was perfect. He was a
father to the boys, a son to his father, a husband to his wife, a friend to his
friends, but to whom was he himself? The digital veil offered a
self-disappearing that made self-expression, finally, possible. When he was no
one, he was free to be himself. It’s not that he was bursting with stifled
sexuality, though he was. It was the freedom that mattered. Which is why, when
she texted, my husband is away this weekend with the kids, come fuck me for
real, she got no response. And why you can’t STILL be jerking off! got no
response. And why what happened to you? were the last words to pass between
their phones.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I could be any
more sorry for what I did,” he said.</p>

<p>“You could start by telling me
you’re sorry.”</p>

<p>“I’ve apologized many times.”</p>

<p>“No, many times you’ve told me that
you’ve apologized. But you’ve never once apologized to me.”</p>

<p>“I did that night in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t.”</p>

<p>“In bed.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“On the phone in the car, when you
were at Model UN.”</p>

<p>“You told me you’d apologized, but
you didn’t apologize. I pay attention, Jacob. I remember. Exactly once, since I
found the phone, did you say, ‘I’m sorry.’ When I told you your grandfather
died. And you weren’t saying it to me. Or to anyone.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter if that’s
the case—”</p>

<p>“It is the case, and it does
matter.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter if that’s the
case, because if you don’t remember an apology, I obviously didn’t apologize
fully enough. So hear me now: I’m so sorry, Julia. I’m ashamed, and I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“It’s not the texts.”</p>

<p>The night Julia found the phone,
she told Jacob, “You seem happy, but you aren’t.” And more: “You find
unhappiness so threatening that you would rather go down with the ship than
acknowledge a leak.” What if she wouldn’t go down with the ship? Because if it
wasn’t the texts, then it was everything. What if, when Jacob closed himself in
the unoccupied room, he closed Julia in the unoccupied house? What if the thing
he needed to apologize for was everything?</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, “just tell me,
why are you going to destroy this family?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare say that.”</p>

<p>“But it’s true. You’re destroying
our family.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. I’m ending our marriage.”</p>

<p>He couldn’t believe what she had
just dared to say.</p>

<p>“Ending our marriage will destroy
our family.”</p>

<p>“No. It won’t.”</p>

<p>“Why? Why are you ending our
marriage?”</p>

<p>“Who have I been having all of
those conversations with for the last three weeks?”</p>

<p>“We were talking.”</p>

<p>She let that reverberate for a
moment, then said, “That’s why.”</p>

<p>“Because we were talking?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re always talking, and
your words never mean anything. You hid your greatest secret behind a wall,
remember that?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Our wedding. I walked seven
circles around you, and I surrounded you with love, for years I did, and the
wall toppled. I toppled it. But you know what I discovered? Your greatest
secret is that you’re wall all the way to the centermost stone. There is
nothing there.”</p>

<p>And now he had no choice: “I’m
going to Israel, Julia.”</p>

<p>And either because of the addition
of her name, or a shift in his tone, or more likely because the conversation
had reached the point of breakage, the sentence took on a new meaning—one that
Julia believed.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe this,” she said.</p>

<p>“I have to.”</p>

<p>“For whom?”</p>

<p>“Our kids. And their kids.”</p>

<p>“Our kids don’t have kids.”</p>

<p>“But they will.”</p>

<p>“So that’s the trade: lose a
father, gain a kid?”</p>

<p>“You said it yourself, Julia:
they’re going to put me behind a computer.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p>“You said they wouldn’t be dumb
enough to give me a gun.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t say that, either.”</p>

<p>Jacob could hear the click of a
lamp. A hotel? Mark’s apartment? How could he ask her where she was in a way
that didn’t convey judgment or jealousy or imply that he was going to Israel to
punish her for having gone to Mark’s?</p>

<p>More than a thousand “constructed
languages” have been invented—by linguists, novelists, hobbyists—each with the
dream of correcting the imprecision, inefficiency, and irregularity of natural
language. Some constructed languages are based on the musical scale and sung.
Some are color-based and silent. The most admired constructed languages were
designed to reveal what communication could be, and none of them is in use.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to do this,” Julia
said, “if you’re really going to do this, I need two things from you.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“If you’re going to go to Israel—”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“—you need to do two things for
me.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>“Sam needs to have a bar mitzvah.
You can’t leave without helping to see that through.”</p>

<p>“OK. Let’s do it tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“As in, today?”</p>

<p>“Wednesday. And we’ll do it here.”</p>

<p>“Does he even know his whole
haftorah yet?”</p>

<p>“He knows enough. We can invite
whatever family can make it, whatever friends Sam wants. The Israelis are here.
I can get ninety percent of what we need at Whole Foods. We’ll skip the
accoutrements, obviously.”</p>

<p>“My parents wouldn’t be able to be
there.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about that. We could
skype with them?”</p>

<p>“And we need a Torah. That’s not an
accoutrement.”</p>

<p>“Right. Shit. If Rabbi Singer won’t
participate—”</p>

<p>“He won’t.”</p>

<p>“My dad can call in a favor from
that shul in Georgetown. He knows a bunch of people there.”</p>

<p>“You’ll take care of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“OK. I can get the … And if I…” She
trailed off into her interior plans, into that never-resting maternal lobe of
her brain, the place that scheduled playdates two weeks out, and was vigilant
about the food allergies of the kids’ friends, and always knew everyone’s shoe
size, and needed no automated reminder to make appointments for biannual dental
checkups, and kept track of the outflow of thank-you notes for birthday
presents.</p>

<p>“What’s the second thing?” Jacob
asked.</p>

<p>“Sorry, what?”</p>

<p>“You said you needed me to do two
things.”</p>

<p>“You need to put down Argus.”</p>

<p>“Put him down?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s time, and because
he’s yours.”</p>

<p>When Jacob was a boy, he used to
stop spinning globes with his finger and imagine what life would be like if he
lived in the Netherlands, or Argentina, or China, or Sudan.</p>

<p>When Jacob was a boy, he imagined
that his finger brought the actual Earth to momentary rest. No one really
noticed it, just as no one really noticed Earth’s rotation, but the sun stayed
where it was in the sky, the ocean went flat, and photos fell from fridges.</p>

<p>When Julia said those words—Because
it’s time, and because he’s yours—her finger held his life in place.</p>

<p>Because it’s time, and because he’s
yours.</p>

<p>The space where those clauses met
was his home.</p>

<p>But could he live there?</p>

<p>At the last convention he attended,
Jacob met two deaf parents and their eight-year-old deaf son. They’d recently
moved to the States from England, the father explained, because the boy had
been in a car accident and lost his left hand.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Jacob signed, making a
ring around his heart with his fist.</p>

<p>The mother touched four fingers to
her bottom lip, then straightened her arm, arcing the fingers down—like blowing
a kiss without the kiss.</p>

<p>Jacob asked, “Are there better
doctors here?”</p>

<p>The mother signed, “British Sign
Language uses both hands for finger spelling. American uses only one. He would
have managed in England, but we want to give him every best chance.”</p>

<p>The mother and boy went off to the
crafts tent while Jacob and the father hung back. They spoke for an hour, in
silence, displacing the air between them with the stories of their lives.</p>

<p>Jacob had read of deaf couples who
wanted deaf children. One couple even genetically selected for a deaf child. He
found himself thinking about that quite often, the moral implications. Once
they had shared enough for it not to feel like prying, Jacob asked the man how
he felt when he learned that his son was deaf, like him.</p>

<p>“People would ask me if I was
hoping for a boy or a girl,” the father signed. “I told them I just wanted a
healthy baby. But I had a very secret preference. Maybe you know that they
don’t perform the hearing test until you’re about to leave the hospital?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that.”</p>

<p>“It works by sending a sound into
the ear—if it echoes back, the baby can hear. So they leave as much time as
they can for the ear to drain of amniotic fluid.”</p>

<p>“If the sound doesn’t echo back,
the child is deaf?”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“Where does the sound go?”</p>

<p>“Into the deafness.”</p>

<p>“So there was a period of not
knowing?”</p>

<p>“A day. For a day, he was neither
deaf nor hearing. When the nurse told us that he was deaf, I cried and cried.”</p>

<p>Jacob once again circled his heart
with his fist.</p>

<p>“No,” the father signed. “A hearing
baby would have been a blessing. A deaf baby was a special blessing.”</p>

<p>“It was your preference?”</p>

<p>“My very secret preference.”</p>

<p>“But what about giving him every
best chance?”</p>

<p>“Can I ask if you’re Jewish?” the
man signed.</p>

<p>The question was so unlikely, Jacob
wasn’t sure he understood it correctly, but he nodded.</p>

<p>“We’re Jewish as well.” Jacob felt
that old, embarrassing, singularly comforting recognition. “Where are your
people from?”</p>

<p>“Everywhere. But mostly Drohobycz.”</p>

<p>“We’re landsmen,” the father
signed. He actually signed, “We’re from the same place,” but Jacob understood
that his hands were speaking Yiddish.</p>

<p>“It’s harder to be Jewish,” the
father signed. “It doesn’t give you every best chance.”</p>

<p>“It’s different,” Jacob signed.</p>

<p>The man signed, “I once read a line
in a poem: ‘You may find a dead bird; you won’t see a flock of them anywhere.’”
The sign for flock is two hands moving like a wave away from the torso.</p>

<p>Jacob returned home from the
convention in time for Shabbat dinner. They lit the candles and blessed them.
They blessed the wine and drank it. They uncovered the challah, blessed it,
tore it, passed it, and ate it. The blessings disappeared into the universe’s
deafness, but when Jacob and Julia whispered into their children’s tiny ears,
the prayers echoed back. After the meal, Jacob and Julia and Sam and Max and
Benjy closed their eyes and moved through their home.</p>

<h1>VI. THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL</h1>

<h2>COME HOME</h2>

<p>In the end, they didn’t need to
rush the bar mitzvah—it took Tamir and Jacob eight days to find a way to
Israel—but apparently there wasn’t enough time to put Argus down. Jacob spoke
with a few compassionate vets, but also watched a few horrible YouTube videos.
Even when euthanasia was clearly a “good” thing—a genuinely suffering animal
being given a genuinely peaceful end—it was horrible. He couldn’t do it. He
wasn’t ready. Argus wasn’t ready. They weren’t ready.</p>

<p>The embassy continued to be
unhelpful, and commercial flights to Israel continued to be halted. So they
looked into getting press certification, volunteering for Doctors Without
Borders, flying to another country and reaching Israel by boat—all nonstarters.</p>

<p>What changed their situation, and
changed everything, was an internationally televised speech by Israel’s prime
minister—a speech that he must have known, when writing it, would either be
memorized by future Jewish schoolchildren or be etched into memorial walls.</p>

<p>Looking directly into the camera,
and directly into the Jewish souls of all Jews watching, he conveyed the
unprecedented threat to Israel’s existence, and asked that Jews between the
ages of sixteen and fifty-five “come home.”</p>

<p>Airspace would be opened to
incoming flights, and commercial jumbo jets, emptied of seats to hold more
bodies, would be flown continuously from airfields near New York, Los Angeles,
Miami, Chicago, Paris, London, Buenos Aires, Moscow, and other major Jewish
population centers.</p>

<p>The planes weren’t fueled until
just before takeoff, as no one knew, even approximately, how heavy they would
be.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>TODAY I AM NOT A MAN</h2>

<p>“We need to have a family
conversation,” Sam said. It was the night before his makeshift bar mitzvah. In
twelve hours, catered food would begin to arrive. And not long after, the
handful of cousins and friends who could make it on such short notice. Then manhood.</p>

<p>Max and Benjy sat on Sam’s bed,
their feet growing toward the floor, and Sam gave his ninety-two pounds to his
beloved swivel chair—beloved because the range of motion made him feel capable,
and beloved because it had been his dad’s. His desktop flickered with footage
of an army moving across the Sinai.</p>

<p>With parental gentleness, Sam
recounted an age-appropriate version of what had happened with their father’s
phone, and what he knew—from the snippets Max had overheard in the car, what
Billie had witnessed and inferred at Model UN, and his own piecing together—of
their mother’s relationship with Mark. (“I don’t get what’s the big deal,”
Benjy said. “People kiss people all the time and it’s nice?”) Sam shared what
Billie had overheard of their parents’ separation-conversation rehearsal
(mortared with the results of Max’s snooping), as well as what Barak had been
told of their fathers’ decision to go to Israel. Everyone knew that Jacob was
lying when he said Julia had spent the night at a site visit, but they also
sensed that he didn’t know where she’d actually been, so no one mentioned it.</p>

<p>Sam often had fantasies of killing
his brothers, but he also had fantasies of saving them. He’d felt the opposing
pulls for as long as they’d been his brothers—with the same arms that cradled
baby Benjy, he wanted to crush his rib cage—and the intensity of those
coexisting impulses defined his brotherly love.</p>

<p>But not now. Now he only wanted to
cradle them. Now he felt no possessiveness, no diminishment at their gain, no
scorching, referentless annoyance.</p>

<p>When Sam reached the
climax—“Everything is about to change”—Max started to cry. Reflexively, Sam
wanted to say, “It’s funny, it’s funny,” but a yet stronger reflex prevailed,
and he said, “I know, I know.” When Max started to cry, Benjy started to
cry—like a reservoir that floods into an overflow reservoir, overflowing it.
“It sucks,” Sam said. “But it’s all going to be OK. We just can’t let it
happen.”</p>

<p>Through his tears, Benjy said, “I
don’t get it. Kissing is nice.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” Max
asked.</p>

<p>“They keep putting everything off
until after my bar mitzvah. They’re going to tell us about their divorce after
my bar mitzvah. Dad is going to move out after my bar mitzvah. And now he’s
going to go to Israel after my bar mitzvah. So I’m not going to have a bar
mitzvah.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good plan,” Benjy said.
“You’re smart.”</p>

<p>“But they’ll just force you to,”
Max said.</p>

<p>“What are they gonna do? Pinch my
nose until I expel my haftorah?”</p>

<p>“Ground you.”</p>

<p>“Who cares?”</p>

<p>“Take away your screen time.”</p>

<p>“Who cares?”</p>

<p>“You do.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>“You could run away?” Benjy
suggested.</p>

<p>“Run away?” his brothers asked at
the same time, and Max couldn’t resist calling, “Jinx!”</p>

<p>“Sam, Sam, Sam,” Benjy said,
relieving his brother of his imposed silence.</p>

<p>“I can’t run away,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“Just until the war ends,” Max
said.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t leave you guys.”</p>

<p>“And I would miss you,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>When Jacob and Julia had shared the
news that Sam and Max were going to get a little brother, Jacob made the
mistake of suggesting the boys name him—a sweet idea that if carried out one
hundred million times would never once produce an acceptable result. Max
quickly settled on Ed the Hyena, after Scar’s loyal henchman in The Lion King,
assuming, presumably, that that’s what his new brother would be: his loyal
henchman. Sam wanted to name him Foamy, because it was the third word his
finger landed on when he was riffling through the dictionary—he’d promised to
commit to the first word, whatever it was, but it was extortion, and the second
was ambivalent. The problem wasn’t that the brothers disagreed, but that both
were such terrific names—Ed the Hyena and Foamy. Great names that any human
would be privileged to have and that would all but guarantee a cool life. They
flipped a coin, and then did best out of three, then seven, and Julia, being
Julia, gently folded the winning name into an origami bird that she released
from an open window, but made the boys T-shirts with iron-on letters that read
“Foamy’s Brother,” and, of course, a “Foamy” onesie. There was a photograph of
the three of them in their Foamy-wear, asleep in the backseat of the Volvo that
was christened Ed the Hyena as an easy-to-give concession to Max.</p>

<p>Sam patted his knees, beckoning
Benjy over, and said, “I’d miss you, too, Foamy.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Foamy?” Benjy asked,
climbing onto his brother.</p>

<p>“You almost were.”</p>

<p>Max found all of this too emotional
to acknowledge or name. “If you run away, I’m coming, too.”</p>

<p>“No one is running away,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“Me, too,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“We need to stay,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“Why?” they asked.</p>

<p>“Jinx!”</p>

<p>“Benjy, Benjy, Benjy.”</p>

<p>Sam could have said, Because you
need to be taken care of, and I can’t do that myself. Or, Because it’s only my
bar mitzvah, so only I need to run from it. Or, Because life isn’t a Wes
Anderson movie. But instead he said, “Because then our house would be
completely empty.”</p>

<p>“It should be,” Max said. “It
deserves to be.”</p>

<p>“And Argus.”</p>

<p>“He’ll come with us.”</p>

<p>“He can’t walk to the corner. How
would he run away?”</p>

<p>Max was becoming desperate: “So
we’ll put him to sleep, and then we’ll run away.”</p>

<p>“You would kill Argus to stop a bar
mitzvah?”</p>

<p>“I would kill Argus to stop life.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, his life.”</p>

<p>“Our life.”</p>

<p>“I have a question,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“What?” his brothers asked in
unison.</p>

<p>“Jinx!”</p>

<p>“Jesus, Max.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Sam, Sam, Sam.”</p>

<p>“What’s your question?”</p>

<p>“Max said you could run away until
the war stops.”</p>

<p>“No one is running away.”</p>

<p>“What if the war never stops?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>O JEWS, YOUR TIME HAS COME!</h2>

<p>Julia came home in time to put the
boys to bed. It wasn’t nearly as painful as either she or Jacob had imagined,
but only because she had imagined a night of silence and Jacob had imagined a
night of screaming. They hugged, exchanged gentle smiles, and got to work.</p>

<p>“My dad procured a Torah.”</p>

<p>“And a rabbi?”</p>

<p>“It was a two-for-one.”</p>

<p>“Please, not a cantor.”</p>

<p>“Thank God, no.”</p>

<p>“And you found everything at Whole
Foods?”</p>

<p>“I got a caterer.”</p>

<p>“The day before?”</p>

<p>“Not the best caterer. Some
unsubstantiated accusations of salmonella.”</p>

<p>“Rumors, I’m sure. We should have
about what, fifteen people? Twenty?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have food for one hundred.”</p>

<p>“All those snow globes…,” Julia
said, genuinely wistfully.</p>

<p>They were gridded on three
linen-closet shelves, fifteen across and eight deep. They would stay there,
untouched, for years—so much trapped water, like all the trapped air in the
saved bubble wrap, like the words trapped in thought bubbles. There must have
been tiny cracks in their domes, as the water slowly evaporated—maybe a quarter-inch
a year?—and by the time Benjy was ready to have, or not have, a bar mitzvah,
the snow was resting on dry city streets, still pure.</p>

<p>“The boys have no idea, by the way.
I just told them you were visiting a site last night and they didn’t ask
anything else.”</p>

<p>“We’ll never know what they know.”</p>

<p>“And neither will they.”</p>

<p>“It was only a night,” she said,
loading dishes into the washer. “But I’ve never chosen to be away from them. It
was always because I had to be. I feel awful.”</p>

<p>Rather than try to diminish her
feeling, Jacob tried to share it: “It’s hard.” But there was that other angel,
its tiny feet nailed to Jacob’s shoulder: “You were at Mark’s?”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Is that where you went?”</p>

<p>There were many ways to answer that
question. She chose: “Yes.”</p>

<p>He brought the extra plates up from
the basement. She took a shower, to release her shoulders and steam Sam’s suit.
He walked Argus to Rosedale, where they listened to other dogs play fetch in
the dark. She ran a load of kids’ underwear and socks and dish towels. And then
they were back in the kitchen, putting away the clean, still-warm dishes.</p>

<p>Without intending to, Julia picked
up where she’d left off earlier: “When they were tiny, I wouldn’t take my eyes
off them for two seconds. But there’s going to come a time when we won’t speak
for days on end.”</p>

<p>“There won’t.”</p>

<p>“There will. Every parent thinks it
will never happen to them, but it happens to everyone.”</p>

<p>“We won’t let it happen.”</p>

<p>“And at the same time we’ll force
it to happen.”</p>

<p>Then they were upstairs. She
searched her toiletries until she couldn’t remember what she was searching for.
He switched the placement of his sweaters and T-shirts—a little early this
year. The windows were black, but she lowered the shades for the morning. He
stood on an ottoman to reach a bulb. And then they were at the side-by-side
sinks, brushing.</p>

<p>“There’s an interesting house for
sale,” Jacob said, “in Rock Creek Park.”</p>

<p>“On Davenport?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>She spat, and said, “The house on
Davenport?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“I saw it.”</p>

<p>“You went to it?”</p>

<p>“The listing.”</p>

<p>“Kind of interesting, no?”</p>

<p>“This house is better,” she said.</p>

<p>“This is the best house.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very good house.”</p>

<p>He spat, then alternated between
rinsing the brush and brushing his tongue. “I should sleep on the sofa,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Or I can.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll go. I should get used to
sleeping in uncomfortable places, toughen myself up a bit.” His joke applied
pressure to something serious.</p>

<p>“The shabby-chic sofa isn’t such a
deprivation.” Her joke pushed back.</p>

<p>“Maybe it would be a good thing if
I set an alarm for quite early, and came back up to the bedroom so the boys
could find us there together in the morning?”</p>

<p>“They’re going to have to know at
some point. And they probably already know.”</p>

<p>“After the bar mitzvah. Let’s give
them this last bit. Even if everyone is in on the make-believe.”</p>

<p>“Are we really not going to say any
more about your going to Israel?”</p>

<p>“What else is there to say?”</p>

<p>“That it’s insane.”</p>

<p>“That’s already been said.”</p>

<p>“That it’s unfair to me, and to the
kids.”</p>

<p>“That’s already been said.”</p>

<p>What hadn’t been said, and what he
wanted to hear, and what might even have made him choose differently, was “That
I don’t want you to go.” But instead she’d given: “You’re not my spouse.”</p>

<p>The sofa was perfectly
comfortable—more comfortable than the seven-thousand-dollar organic kelp and
pony hair mattress Julia had insisted on buying—but Jacob couldn’t sleep. He
couldn’t even make it to tossing and turning. He wasn’t sure what he felt—it
could have been guilt, it could have been humiliation, or just sadness—and as
always, when he couldn’t place a feeling, it became anger.</p>

<p>He went to the basement and turned
on the TV. CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, ABC: it was all coverage of the Middle East,
all interchangeable. Why could he never admit that he was just looking for his
show, which wasn’t even his show? It wasn’t ego, it was self-flagellation.
Which was ego.</p>

<p>There it was, syndicated on TBS.
Sometimes Jacob convinced himself it was better with the swearing and brief
flashes of nudity removed, that they were there only because the freedom to do
such things had to be justified by exercising it. Jacob wondered what the
executive producers were making for the airing, and switched the station.</p>

<p>He flipped past some sort of
cooking reality show, some sort of X Games something or other, past one of the
despicable Despicable Me iterations. Everything was another version of
something that was never good to begin with. He made a full journey around the
planet of television, ending at his point of departure: CNN.</p>

<p>Wolf Blitzer had once again
relieved the horrible tension of his purgatorial beard—neither a beard nor not
a beard—with yet another new pair of glasses. He was a man on TV standing in
front of a TV, using this TV-in-a-TV to explain the geopolitics of the Middle
East. Jacob zoned out. Normally, he would have taken this moment of mental
meandering to contemplate masturbating, or whether whatever Pirate Booty rubble
could be found at the bottom of the bag would justify the trip upstairs. But
instead, inspired by the next day’s bar mitzvah, he thought about his own,
almost thirty years before. His portion was Ki Tissa, which, his bad luck,
happened to be the longest portion in Exodus, and among the longest in the
Torah. He remembered that much. Ki Tissa means “when you take,” the first
distinctive words in the portion, referring to the first census of the Jews. He
had some vague memory of the melodies, but they could just as well have been
generic Jewish-sounding musical phrases, the kind people fall back on when
faking a prayer they are embarrassed not to know.</p>

<p>There was a lot of drama in the
portion: the first census, Moses ascending Mount Sinai, the golden calf, Moses
destroying the tablets, Moses ascending Mount Sinai a second time and returning
with what would be the Ten Commandments. But what he remembered most clearly
wasn’t even in the parsha itself, but a related text, a passage of the Talmud,
given to him by his rabbi, which addressed the question of what was done with
the broken tablets. Even as an uninterested thirteen-year-old, it struck Jacob
as a beautiful question. According to the Talmud, God instructed Moses to put
both the intact tablets and the broken tablets in the ark. The Jews carried
them—the broken and the whole—for their forty years of wandering, and placed them
both in the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the rabbi, whose face
Jacob couldn’t visualize, and whose voice he couldn’t conjure, and who was
certainly no longer living. “Why didn’t they just bury them, as would befit a
sacred text? Or leave them behind, as would befit a blasphemy?”</p>

<p>By the time Jacob’s focus shifted
back to CNN, Wolf was addressing a hologram of the Ayatollah, speculating about
the contents of his forthcoming speech—the first public comments out of Iran
since the fire at the Dome of the Rock. There was apparently great anticipation
in the Muslim and Jewish worlds for what he would say, as it would establish
the most extreme response to the situation, draw the outer edge.</p>

<p>Jacob ran upstairs, grabbed the
Pirate Booty—and a pack of roasted seaweed, and the last two Newman’s Own Oreo
imitations, and a bottle of Hefeweizen—and hustled back down in time to catch
the beginning. Wolf hadn’t mentioned that the speech would be delivered
outside, in Azadi Square, in front of two hundred thousand people. He’d managed
to commit the unpardonable sin of TV journalism: to undersell, to reduce
expectations, to make actually necessary television seem optional.</p>

<p>A slightly chubby man approached
the microphone: pitch-black turban, snow-white beard, black robe like a black
balloon filled with shouting. There was an undeniable wisdom in his eyes, even
a gentleness. There was absolutely nothing to distinguish his face from that of
a Jew.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>COME HOME</h2>

<p>“It is now nine p.m. in Israel. Two
p.m. in New York. It is seven p.m. in London, eleven a.m. in Los Angeles, eight
p.m. in Paris, three p.m. in Buenos Aires, nine p.m. in Moscow, four a.m. in
Melbourne.</p>

<p>“This speech is being broadcast
around the world, on every major news outlet. It is being simultaneously
translated into dozens of languages, and will be viewed by people of every
religion and race and culture in the world. But I am speaking only to Jews.</p>

<p>“Since the devastating earthquake
two weeks ago, Israel has endured calamity after calamity, some brought upon us
by the indifferent hand of Mother Nature, some by the fists of our enemies.
With ingenuity, strength, and resolve, we have done what Jews have always done:
we have survived. How many more-powerful peoples have vanished from the face of
the earth while the Jewish people have survived? Where are the Vikings? Where
are the Mayans? The Hittites? The Mesopotamians? And where are our historical
enemies, who have always outnumbered us? Where are the pharaohs, who destroyed
our firstborn but could not destroy us? Where are the Babylonians, who
destroyed our Holy Temple but could not destroy us? Where is the Roman Empire,
which destroyed our Second Temple but could not destroy us? Where are the
Nazis, who could not destroy us?</p>

<p>“They are gone.</p>

<p>“And here we are.</p>

<p>“Spread across the globe, we have
different dreams in different languages, but we are joined in a richer, prouder
history than can be claimed by any other people to have graced the earth. We
have survived, and survived, and survived, and have come to assume that we
always will. But brothers and sisters, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah, I come to you tonight to tell you that
survival is the story of the Jewish people only because the Jewish people have
not been destroyed. If we survive ten thousand calamities, and then, in the
end, we are destroyed, the story of the Jews will be the story of destruction.
Brothers and sisters, heirs of kings and queens, prophets and holy
men—children, all of us, of the Jewish mother who released the wicker basket
into the river of history—we are cast into the current, and this moment will
determine our story.</p>

<p>“As King Solomon knew, ‘A righteous
man falls down seven times and gets up.’ We have fallen down seven times, and
seven times we have gotten up. We have been struck by an earthquake of
unprecedented proportions. We have endured the collapse of our homes, the loss
of basic utilities, aftershocks, disease, missile attacks, and now we are
assailed on every side by enemies funded and armed by superpowers, while
support for us has wavered, while our friends have averted their eyes. Our
righteousness has not diminished, but we cannot fall down again. We were
defeated two thousand years ago, and we were doomed to two thousand years of
exile. As the prime minister of the State of Israel, I am here to tell you
tonight that if we fall down again, the book of Lamentations will not only be
given a new chapter, it will be given an end. The story of the Jewish
people—our story—will be told alongside the stories of the Vikings and Mayans.</p>

<p>“Exodus recounts a battle between
Israel and Amalek: man against man, army against army, people against people,
with commanders observing from vantage points far behind their own lines. While
he watches the battle, Moses notices that when his arms are raised, Israel
makes advances, and when they are lowered, Israel takes losses. So he keeps his
arms raised in front of him. But, as we are again and again reminded, Moses is
only human. And no human can keep his arms raised forever.</p>

<p>“Fortunately, Moses’s brother,
Aaron, and brother-in-law, Hur, are nearby. He summons them, and they hold up
his arms for the duration of the battle. Israel is victorious.</p>

<p>“As I speak to you, the Israeli Air
Force, in collaboration with the other branches of the Israel Defense Forces,
is commencing Operation Arms of Moses. Beginning in eight hours, El Al planes
will be departing from major Jewish population centers around the world to
bring Jewish men and women between the ages of sixteen and fifty-five to
military stations in Israel. Those flights will be met by fighter jets, to
ensure safe travel. Upon arriving in Israel, our brave brothers and sisters
will be assessed and directed to how they can best support the effort of
survival. Detailed information about the operation can be found at
operationarmsofmoses.</p>

<p>“We have been preparing for this.
We brought home our Ethiopian brothers and sisters from the desert. We brought
home Russian Jews, and Iraqi Jews, and French Jews. We brought home those who
survived the horrors of the Holocaust. But this will be an unprecedented
undertaking—unprecedented in Israel’s history, and unprecedented in world
history. But this is an unprecedented crisis. The only way to prevent our total
destruction is with the totality of our strength.</p>

<p>“By the end of the first
twenty-four hours of flights, we will have brought fifty thousand Jews to
Israel.</p>

<p>“By the end of the third day, three
hundred thousand.</p>

<p>“On the seventh day, the Diaspora
will be home: one million Jews, fighting shoulder to shoulder with their Jewish
brothers and sisters. And with these Aarons and Hurs, our arms will not only be
raised in victory, we will be able to dictate the peace.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>TODAY I AM NOT A MAN</h2>

<p>They unrolled the Torah on the
kitchen island, and Sam chanted with a grace that had never before touched a
member of the Bloch family—the grace of being fully present as oneself. Irv
lacked such grace, was self-conscious about crying, and held in his tears.
Julia lacked such grace, was too concerned with etiquette to respond to her
most primitive instinct to go to her son and stand beside him. Jacob lacked
such grace, and cared enough to wonder what others were thinking.</p>

<p>The Torah was closed and dressed
and replaced in the cabinet that had been emptied of shelves and art supplies.
The men who surrounded Sam took their seats, leaving him alone to chant his
haftorah, which he did slowly, resolutely, with the care of an ophthalmologist
performing surgery on his own eyes. The rituals were complete. All that
remained was his speech.</p>

<p>Sam stood there, at the
kitchen-island bimah. He imagined a cone of dusty light projecting from his
forehead, creating everything in front of him: the yarmulke on Benjy’s head
(Wedding of Jacob and Julia, August 23, 2000), the tallis that wrapped around
his grandfather like an unfinished ghost costume, the unoccupied folding chair
on which his great-grandfather sat.</p>

<p>He walked around the island, then
awkwardly between chairs, and put his arm on Max’s shoulder. With a physical
closeness that neither could have borne in any other moment, Sam took Max’s
face into his hands and whispered something into his ear. It wasn’t a plan. It
wasn’t a secret. It wasn’t information. Max softened like a yahrzeit candle.</p>

<p>Sam made his way back to the other
side of the island.</p>

<p>“Hello, gathered. So. Right. Well.
What can I say?</p>

<p>“You know how sometimes, when
someone wins an award, they pretend that they were so sure they weren’t going
to win it, they didn’t bother to prepare a speech? I don’t believe that that
has ever once, in human history, been true. Or at least not if it’s for an
Oscar, or something big like that, and the awards are televised. I guess people
think that saying they didn’t prepare a speech will make them sound modest, or
even worse, down-to-earth, but they actually sound like totally disingenuous
narcissists.</p>

<p>“I guess a bar mitzvah speech is
like a plane in a storm: once you’re in it, there’s no way out but through.
Great-Grandpa taught me that expression, even though he hadn’t been in a plane
for like thirty years. He loved expressions. I think they made him feel
American.</p>

<p>“This isn’t really a speech. To be
honest, I didn’t think I’d be here, so I didn’t prepare anything, other than my
original bar mitzvah speech, which wouldn’t make any sense now, given that
everything has completely changed. But I did work on it a lot, so if anyone
wants it, I suppose I could e-mail it to them later. Anyway, I brought up that
thing about actors who say they didn’t prepare a speech, because maybe
demonstrating my awareness of the untrustworthiness of saying you are
unprepared might give you a reason to believe me. The real question is why I
care if you believe me.</p>

<p>“Anyway, Grandpa Irv used to do
this thing where he’d give Max and me five bucks if we made a speech that
convinced him of something. Anytime, anything. So we were constantly making
little speeches: why people shouldn’t have dogs as pets, why escalators
encourage obesity and should be illegal, why robots will defeat humans in our
lifetime, why Bryce Harper should be traded, why it’s OK to swat flies. There
was nothing we wouldn’t argue, because even though we didn’t need the money, we
wanted it. We liked how it accumulated. Or we wanted to win. Or to be loved. I
don’t know. I’m mentioning it because I guess it made us pretty good at
speaking off the cuff, which is what I am now about to do. Thanks, Grandpa?</p>

<p>“I never wanted to have a bar
mitzvah in the first place. My objection wasn’t moral or intellectual, I just
thought it would be a colossal waste of time. Maybe that’s moral? I don’t know.
I assume I would have continued to object even if my parents had genuinely
listened to me, or proposed other ways of thinking about a bar mitzvah. We’ll
never know, because I was simply told that it’s what we do, because it’s what
we do. In the same way that not eating cheeseburgers is what we don’t do,
because it’s what we don’t do. Even though we do sometimes eat real-crab
California rolls, even though it’s what we don’t do. And we often don’t observe
Shabbat, even though it’s what we do. I don’t have any problem with hypocrisy
when it’s self-serving, but applying the logic of what we do to having a bar
mitzvah didn’t serve me.</p>

<p>“So I made efforts to sabotage it.
I tried not to learn my haftorah, but Mom would put on the recording whenever
we were in the car, and it’s actually unbelievably catchy—everyone in the
family can recite it, and Argus starts beating his tail with the first verse.</p>

<p>“I was incredibly obnoxious to my
tutor, but he was happy enough eating my crap if it meant cashing my parents’
checks.</p>

<p>“As some of you might know, I was
accused of writing some inappropriate words in Hebrew school. As terrible as it
felt not to be believed, I was happy to get in trouble if it would get me out
of this. Which it clearly didn’t.</p>

<p>“I’ve never thought about it until
right now, but it occurs to me that I don’t know if I’ve ever actually tried to
stop anything from happening in my life. I mean, obviously I’ve tried to get
out of the way of inside pitches, and I make a lot of efforts not to use
urinals without vertical privacy shields, but an event. I never tried to stop a
birthday or, I don’t know, Hanukkah. Maybe my inexperience made me think it
would be easier. But for all of my efforts, Jewish manhood only got nearer.</p>

<p>“Then the earthquake happened, and
that changed everything, and my great-grandfather died, and that also changed
everything, and Israel got attacked by everyone, and a whole lot of other things
happened that this is not the right time or place to get into, and suddenly
everything was different. And as everything kept changing, my reasons for not
wanting to have a bar mitzvah changed and became stronger. It wasn’t just that
it was a colossal waste of time—that time was already wasted, if you think
about it. And it wasn’t even that I knew that lots of bad things were going to
happen after my bar mitzvah, so the effort to stop my bar mitzvah from
happening was actually an effort to stop all kinds of bad things from
happening.</p>

<p>“You can’t stop things from
happening. You can only choose not to be there, like Great-Grandpa Isaac did,
or give yourself completely over, like my dad, who made his big decision to go
to Israel to fight. Or maybe it’s Dad who is choosing not to be there, which is
here, and Great-Grandpa who gave himself over completely.</p>

<p>“We read Hamlet in school this
year, and everybody knows the whole ‘To be or not to be’ business, and we
talked about it for like three consecutive classes—the choice between life and
death, action and reflection, whatever and whatever. It was kind of going
nowhere until my friend Billie said something incredibly smart. She said,
‘Isn’t there another option besides those two? Like, to mostly be or mostly not
be, that is the question.’ And that got me thinking that also maybe one doesn’t
have to exactly choose. ‘To be or not to be. That is the question.’ To be and
not to be. That is the answer.</p>

<p>“My Israeli cousin Noam—that’s his
dad, Tamir, over there—told me that a bar mitzvah isn’t something you have, but
something you become. He was right, and he was wrong. A bar mitzvah is both
something you have and something you become. I am obviously having a bar
mitzvah today. I chanted my Torah portion and haftorah, and no one was holding
a gun to my head. But I want to take this opportunity to make clear to everyone
that I am not becoming one. I did not ask to be a man, and I do not want to be
a man, and I refuse to be a man.</p>

<p>“Dad once told me a story about
when he was a kid and there was a dead squirrel on the lawn. He watched Grandpa
take care of it. After, he said to Grandpa, ‘I couldn’t have done that.’ And
Grandpa said, ‘Sure you could.’ And Dad said, ‘I couldn’t.’ And Grandpa said,
‘When you’re a dad, there’s no one after you.’ And Dad said, ‘I still couldn’t
do it.’ And Grandpa said, ‘The more you won’t want to do it, the more of a dad
you’ll be.’ I don’t want to be like that, so I won’t.</p>

<p>“Now let me explain why I wrote all
those words.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>O JEWS, YOUR TIME HAS COME!</h2>

<p>“O Muslims, the hour is here! The
war of God against the enemies of God will end in triumph! Victory in the Holy
Land of Palestine is within the reach of the righteous. We will have our
revenge for Lydda, we will have our revenge for Haifa and Acre and Deir Yassin,
we will have our revenge for the generations of martyrs, we will have our
revenge, praise Allah, for al-Quds! Oh, al-Quds, raped by the Jews, treated
like a whore by the sons of pigs and apes, we will restore to you your crown
and your glory!</p>

<p>“They burned Qubbat Al-Sakhra to
the ground. But it is they who will be burned. I say to you today the words
that filled the hearts of a thousand martyrs: ‘Khaybar, Khaybar, ya Yahud, Jaish
Muhammad Saouf Ya’ud!’ As the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon Him, defeated the
perfidious Jews at Khaybar, so too will the armies of Muhammad inflict the
final humiliation on the Jews today!</p>

<p>“O Jews, your time has come! Your
fire will be met by fire! We will burn your cities and your towns, your schools
and your hospitals, your every home! No Jew will be safe! I remind you, O
Muslims, of what the Prophet, peace be upon Him, teaches us: that on Judgment
Day even the stones and the trees will speak, with or without words, and say,
‘O servant of Allah, O Muslim, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him!’”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>COME HOME</h2>

<p>“‘Watch me,’ Gideon told his men,
greatly outnumbered, facing the Midianites not far from where I now stand.
‘Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do. When I
and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow
yours and shout, “For the Lord and for Gideon.”’ At the sight and sound of our
unity, the enemy scattered and fled.</p>

<p>“The majority of the Jewish people
have chosen not to live in Israel, and Jews do not share any one set of
political or religious beliefs, and do not share a culture or language. But we
are in the same river of history.</p>

<p>“To the Jews of the world, those
who came before you—your grandparents, your great-grandparents—and those who
will come after you—your grandchildren, your great-grandchildren—are calling
out: ‘Come home.’</p>

<p>“Come home not only because your
home needs you, but because you need your home.</p>

<p>“Come home not only to fight for
Israel’s survival, but to fight for your own.</p>

<p>“Come home because a people without
a home is not a people, just as a person without a home is not a person.</p>

<p>“Come home not because you agree
with everything Israel does, not because you think Israel is perfect, or even
any better than other countries. Come home not because Israel is what you want
it to be, but because it is yours.</p>

<p>“Come home, because history will
remember what each of us chooses in this moment.</p>

<p>“Come home and we will win this war
and establish a lasting peace.</p>

<p>“Come home and we will rebuild this
state to be stronger and closer to its promise than it was before the
destruction.</p>

<p>“Come home and be another hand
around the pen that writes the story of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>“Come home and hold the arms of
Moses aloft. And then, when the guns have cooled, and the buildings have risen
where they once stood, only prouder, and the streets are filled with the sounds
of children playing, you will find your name not in the book of Lamentations, but
the book of Life.</p>

<p>“And then, wherever you choose to
go next, you will always be home.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>TODAY I AM NOT A MAN</h2>

<p>“A couple of weeks ago, everybody
was obsessing over what kind of apology I would give during my bar mitzvah
speech. How would I explain my behavior? Would I even fess up to it? When I was
being blamed, I didn’t feel like explaining myself, much less apologizing. But
now that other things have taken everyone’s attention, and no one really cares
anymore, I’d like to explain myself and apologize.</p>

<p>“My friend Billie, whom I mentioned
before, told me I was repressed. She’s really beautiful, and intelligent, and good.
I told her, ‘Maybe I just have inner peace.’ She said, ‘Peace between what
parties?’ I thought that was such an interesting question.</p>

<p>“I told her, ‘I’m really not
repressed.’ She said, ‘That’s exactly what a repressed person would say.’ So I
said, ‘And I suppose you aren’t repressed?’ And she said, ‘Everyone is somewhat
repressed.’ ‘OK,’ I said, ‘then I’m no more repressed than an average person.’</p>

<p>“‘Say the hardest thing,’ she said.</p>

<p>“I was like, ‘What?’</p>

<p>“And she said, ‘I don’t mean right
this second. You couldn’t even know what it is without thinking long and hard
about it. But once you figure it out, I dare you to say it.’</p>

<p>“‘And if I do?’</p>

<p>“‘You won’t.’</p>

<p>“‘But if.’</p>

<p>“She said, ‘I would invite you to
choose the terms, but I know you’re too repressed to tell me what you’d
actually want.’</p>

<p>“Which was obviously true.</p>

<p>“‘So maybe that’s actually the
hardest thing to say,’ I said.</p>

<p>“She said, ‘What? That you want to
kiss me? Doesn’t even make the top hundred.’</p>

<p>“I thought a lot about what she
said. And I was thinking about it in Hebrew school that day when I wrote those
words. I was just seeing how each of them felt, seeing how hard it was to write
them, and say them to myself. That’s why I did it. But that’s not the point.</p>

<p>“The point is: I made a mistake. I
thought that the worst thing to say was the hardest thing to say. But it’s
actually pretty easy to say horrible things: retard, cunt, whatever. In a way,
it’s even easier because we know exactly how bad the words are. There’s nothing
scary about them. Part of what makes something really hard to say is the not
knowing.</p>

<p>“The reason I’m here today is
because I realized that the hardest thing to say isn’t a word, or a sentence,
but an event. The hardest thing to say couldn’t be something you say to
yourself. It requires the hardest person, or people, to say it to.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>O JEWS, YOUR TIME HAS COME!</h2>

<p>“O Muslims, God demands of his
servants the deaths of these Jews. I call on the soldiers of the Qur’an to wage
our final battle against those beasts who kill the prophets. O Muslims, must I
tell you the story of the Jewish woman who gave the Prophet, peace be upon Him,
poisoned lamb, to kill Him? The Prophet, peace be upon Him, said to his
companions, ‘Do not eat this lamb. It is telling me it has poison in it.’ But
it was too late for the companion Bishr ibn al-Bara, who died from the poison.
The Jewess tried to kill our Prophet, peace be upon Him, but praise God, she
failed. This is the nature of the Jews, these twice-cursed people! They will
try to kill you, but Allah will plant knowledge of their wicked deeds in your
hearts, and save you. You must do as the Prophet, peace be upon Him, did with
the Jew Kenana ibn al-Rabi, who hid the treasure of the Jews, the Banu Nadir.
The Prophet, peace be upon Him, told Az-Zubair ibn Al-Awwam, ‘Torture this Jew
until you learn from him what he knows.’ He held hot steel to his chest and he
nearly died. And then the Prophet, peace be upon Him, delivered the Jew Kenana
to Muhammad ibn Maslamah, and he cut off his head! Then he took the Jews of
Kenana as slaves. Muhammad, peace be upon Him, took the most beautiful woman of
the Jews for himself! This is the way, O Muslims! Let the Prophet be your
teacher in your dealings with the Jews!</p>

<p>“O brother Palestinians! Remember!
When the Muslims, the Arabs, the Palestinians, make war against the Jews, they
do so to worship Allah. They enter the war as Muslims! The hadith does not say,
‘O Sunni, O Shiite, O Palestinian, O Syrian, O Persian, come fight.’ It says,
‘O Muslim’! For too long we have battled ourselves and lost. Now we will battle
together and be victorious.</p>

<p>“We are fighting in the name of
Islam, because Islam commands us to wage war unto death against anyone who
plunders our land. Surrender is the way of Satan!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>COME HOME</h2>

<p>But then, after his final word, the
camera stayed on the prime minister. His gaze held. And the camera held. At
first it seemed like an awkward broadcasting mistake, but it was no accident.</p>

<p>His gaze held.</p>

<p>And the camera held.</p>

<p>And then the prime minister did
something so outrageously symbolic, so potentially kitschy, so many miles over
the top, it risked breaking the legs of its intended recipients just as they
approached the necessary leap of faith.</p>

<p>He removed a shofar from beneath
the lectern. And without any explanation of its meaning—its biblical or
historical significance, its intent to awaken sleeping Jews to repent and
return, without even sharing that this particular shofar, this twice-curled
ram’s horn, was two thousand years old, that it was the shofar discovered at
Masada, stashed in a water hole and preserved by the dry desert heat, that its
inside contained biological remnants of a noble Jewish martyr—he brought it to
his lips.</p>

<p>The camera held.</p>

<p>The prime minister inhaled, and
gathered into the ram’s horn the molecules of every Jew who had ever lived: the
breath of warrior kings and fishmongers; tailors, matchmakers, and executive
producers; kosher butchers, radical publishers, kibbutzniks, management
consultants, orthopedic surgeons, tanners, and judges; the grateful laugh of
someone with more than forty grandchildren gathered in his hospital room; the
false moan of a prostitute who hid children under the bed on which she kissed
Nazis on the mouth; the sigh of an ancient philosopher at a moment of
understanding; the cry of a new orphan alone in a forest; the final air bubble
to rise from the Seine and burst as Paul Celan sank, his pockets full of
stones; the word clear from the lips of the first Jewish astronaut, strapped
into a chair facing infinity. And the breath of those who never lived, but
whose existence Jewish existence depended on: the patriarchs, matriarchs, and
prophets; Abel’s last plea; Sarah’s laughter at the prospect of the miracle;
Abraham offering his God and his son what could not be offered to both: “Here I
am.”</p>

<p>The prime minister aimed the shofar
forty-five degrees, sixty degrees, and in New York, and in Los Angeles, and in
Miami, Chicago, and Paris, in London, Buenos Aires, Moscow, and Melbourne,
television screens trembled, they shook.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>TODAY I AM NOT A MAN</h2>

<p>“The hardest thing to say is the
hardest thing to hear: forced to choose between my parents, I would be able to.</p>

<p>“And I’ve talked about it with Max
and Benjy, and if forced to choose, each of them could choose as well. Two of
us would have chosen one, and one of us the other, but we agreed that if forced
to choose, we would all choose the same one, so that we could stay together.</p>

<p>“When I did Model UN a couple of
weeks ago, the country we were representing, Micronesia, suddenly came into
possession of a nuclear weapon. We didn’t ask for a nuclear weapon, and didn’t
want a nuclear weapon, and nuclear weapons are, in pretty much every way,
horrible. But there’s a reason people have them, and it’s to never have to use
them.</p>

<p>“That’s it. I’m finished.”</p>

<p>He didn’t bow, they didn’t clap. No
one moved or spoke.</p>

<p>As always, Sam didn’t know what to
do with his body. But the organism that was the roomful of family and friends
seemed to depend on his movement. If he started to cry, someone would comfort
him. If he ran out, someone would follow. If he’d just go talk to Max, everyone
would schmooze. But if he continued to stand there, fists balled, they would
continue to stand there.</p>

<p>Jacob thought maybe he could clap
his hands, smile, and say something lame, like “Dig in!”</p>

<p>Julia thought maybe she could go to
Sam, put her arm around him, and touch her head to his head.</p>

<p>Even Benjy, who, by virtue of never
giving it any thought, always knew what to do, was motionless.</p>

<p>Irv longed to assume the authority
of the family’s new patriarch, but he didn’t know how. Was there a five-dollar
bill in his pocket?</p>

<p>From the middle of the room, Billie
said, “Yet.”</p>

<p>Everyone turned to her.</p>

<p>“What?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>There was no sound to overcome, but
she screamed: “Yet!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>O JEWS, YOUR TIME HAS COME!</h2>

<p>The cheering would continue long
after the Ayatollah lowered his final raised arm of solidarity. Long after he
made his way behind the temporary stage, surrounded by a dozen plainclothes
bodyguards. The cheering—the applauding, the chanting, the hollering, the
singing—would continue after he was greeted by a line of his closest advisers,
each kissing him, blessing him. After he was put into a car with two-inch-thick
windows and no door handles and driven away. The cheering continued, and
intensified, but without a gravitational center, the crowd moved outward in
every direction.</p>

<p>Wolf Blitzer and his panel started
discussing the speech—without the time to digest the translation, they just
pulled quote after quote until they’d reassembled it out of order—but the
camera stayed on the crowd. The mass of people couldn’t be contained by Azadi
Square, which pumped them through the connecting streets like blood, and it
couldn’t be contained by the camera’s frame.</p>

<p>Jacob imagined every street in
Tehran packed with people throwing fists in the air, beating their chests. He
imagined every park and gathering space overflowing like Azadi Square. The
camera closed on a woman slapping the back of one hand into the palm of the
other, over and over; a boy screaming from his father’s shoulders, four arms in
the air. There were people on balconies, on rooftops, on the branches of trees.
People atop cars and corrugated metal awnings too hot to be touched with bare
skin.</p>

<p>The Ayatollah’s words had dripped
into more than a billion open ears, and there had been two hundred thousand
pairs of fixed eyes in the square, and 0.2 percent of the world was Jewish, but
watching the replays of the speech—the Ayatollah’s gesticulating fists, the
crowd’s undulations—Jacob thought only of his family.</p>

<p>Before they were allowed to take
Sam home from the hospital when he was born, Jacob had to sit through a
fifteen-minute course covering the Ten Commandments of Caring for a Newborn—the
absolute rudiments of new parenting: YOU SHALL NOT SHAKE YOUR BABY; YOU SHALL
CARE FOR THE UMBILICAL STUMP WITH A COTTON SWAB SOAKED IN WARM WATER AND SOAP,
AT LEAST ONCE A DAY; YOU SHALL BE AWARE OF THE FONTANEL; YOU SHALL FEED YOUR
BABY ONLY BREAST MILK OR FORMULA, BETWEEN ONE AND THREE OUNCES, EVERY TWO TO
THREE HOURS, AND YOU SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO BURP YOUR BABY IF HE FALLS
ASLEEP AFTER A FEEDING; and so on. All things that anyone who had gone to a
parenting class, or had ever spent time in the presence of a baby, or had
simply been born Jewish, would already know. But the Tenth Commandment rattled
Jacob. YOU SHALL REMEMBER: IT WILL NOT LAST.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>COME HOME</h2>

<p>After the guests went home, after
Uber came for the Torah, after Tamir took all the kids to the Nats game (where,
thanks to Max’s thoughtful ingenuity, Sam’s bar mitzvah was announced on the
scoreboard during the seventh-inning stretch), after a bit of unnecessary
e-mailing, after a walk to the corner with Argus, Jacob and Julia were left to
clean up. Before they had kids, if asked to conjure images of parenthood they
would have said things like “Reading in bed,” and “Giving a bath,” and “Running
while holding the seat of a bicycle.” Parenthood contains such moments of
warmth and intimacy, but isn’t them. It’s cleaning up. The great bulk of family
life involves no exchange of love, and no meaning, only fulfillment. Not the
fulfillment of feeling fulfilled, but of fulfilling that which now falls to
you.</p>

<p>Julia couldn’t bring herself to
accept paper plates in the end, so there were a few loads of dishes to do.
Jacob filled the machine to the brim and then hand-washed the rest, he and
Julia taking turns with the soaping-up and the drying-off.</p>

<p>“You were right not to believe
him,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Apparently. But you were right
that we should have believed him.”</p>

<p>“Did we mishandle it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Julia said. “Is
that even the question? Everything with kids is some kind of mishandling. So we
try to learn, and mishandle it less badly in the future. But in the meantime,
they’ve changed, so the lesson doesn’t apply.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lose-lose.”</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>“A love-love.”</p>

<p>The sponge was already well on its
way to mush, the only clean dish towel was damp, and the dish soap had to be
diluted with water for there to be enough, but they made it work.</p>

<p>“Listen,” Jacob said. “Not
fatalistically, but responsibly, I arranged a whole bunch of things with the
accountant and lawyer, and—”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s all pretty clearly
spelled out in a document that I put on your bedside table—in a sealed
envelope, in case one of the kids came upon it.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to die.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“You’re not even going to go.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>She turned on the disposal, and
Jacob had the thought that if he were a Foley artist tasked with creating the
sound of Satan screaming out from hell, he might just hold a mic to what he was
now hearing.</p>

<p>“Another thing,” he said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait till it’s done.”</p>

<p>She switched it off.</p>

<p>“Remember I mentioned that I’ve
been working on a show for a long time?”</p>

<p>“Your secret masterpiece.”</p>

<p>“I never described it like that.”</p>

<p>“About us.”</p>

<p>“Very loosely.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what you’re referring
to.”</p>

<p>“There’s a copy of it in the
bottom-right drawer of my desk.”</p>

<p>“The whole thing?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And on top is the bible.”</p>

<p>“The Bible?”</p>

<p>“For the show. It’s a kind of guide
for how to read it. For future actors, a future director.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t the work speak for
itself?”</p>

<p>“Nothing speaks for itself.”</p>

<p>“Sam sure does.”</p>

<p>“If the show were Sam, it wouldn’t
need a bible.”</p>

<p>“And if you were Sam, you wouldn’t
need a show.”</p>

<p>“Correct.”</p>

<p>“OK. So your show and its bible are
in the bottom-right drawer of your desk. And in the event that you actually go
to Israel and, what, perish in battle? I’m supposed to send it to your agent?”</p>

<p>“No. Please, Julia.”</p>

<p>“Burn it?”</p>

<p>“I’m not Kafka.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I was hoping you’d read it.”</p>

<p>“If you die.”</p>

<p>“And only if.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know if I’m touched by how
open you’re being, or hurt by how closed off you are.”</p>

<p>“You heard Sam: ‘To be and not to
be.’”</p>

<p>Julia wiped the suds from the
counter and hung the dish towel over the faucet. “Now what?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Jacob said, taking his
phone from his pocket to check the time. “It’s three o’clock, which is too
early to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Are you tired?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “I’m just used to
being tired.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that means, but
OK.”</p>

<p>“Aqua seafoam shame.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Don’t assume it has to mean
anything.” Jacob put his palm on the counter and said, “It’s you, of course.
What Sam said.”</p>

<p>“What he said about what?”</p>

<p>“You know. About whom he’d pick.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said with a kind smile,
“of course it’s me. The real question is, who was the dissenter?”</p>

<p>“That might very well have been a
little weapon of psychological warfare.”</p>

<p>“You’re probably right.”</p>

<p>They laughed again.</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you asked me not to go
to Israel?”</p>

<p>“Because after sixteen years, it
goes without saying.”</p>

<p>“Look! A crying Hebrew baby.”</p>

<p>“Look! A pharaoh’s deaf daughter.”</p>

<p>Jacob slid his hands into his
pockets and said, “I know sign language.”</p>

<p>Julia laughed. “What?”</p>

<p>“I’m completely serious.”</p>

<p>“No, you aren’t.”</p>

<p>“I’ve known it for as long as
you’ve known me.”</p>

<p>“You’re full of shit.”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Sign, I’m full of shit.”</p>

<p>Jacob pointed to himself, then
moved his open right hand over the top of his left fist, then he held out his
right hand with the thumb sticking up, grabbed the thumb in the fist of his
left hand, and pulled his left hand up and off the thumb.</p>

<p>“How am I supposed to know if
that’s real?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“Sign, Life is long.”</p>

<p>Jacob made his hands into the shape
that kids use for guns, aimed his forefingers at his belly, then traced them up
his torso toward his neck. Then he extended his left arm, pointed at the fist with
his right forefinger, and moved the finger along his arm up to his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Wait, are you crying?” Jacob
asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you about to?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “Are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m always about to.”</p>

<p>“Sign, Look! A crying Hebrew baby.”</p>

<p>Jacob held his right hand by his
face, about eye level, raised his index and middle fingers, and pushed his arm
forward—two eyes moving forward in space. Then he ran the forefinger of each
hand down his cheeks, one at a time and alternating, as if painting tears onto
himself. Then, with his right hand, he stroked an imaginary beard. Then he
created a cradle of his arms, palms up and overlapped at belly level, and
rocked it back and forth.</p>

<p>“That beard-stroking? That’s the
sign for Hebrew?”</p>

<p>“For Hebrew, for Jew. Yes.”</p>

<p>“That manages to be at once
anti-Semitic and misogynistic.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you know that most Nazis
were deaf.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did know that.”</p>

<p>“And French people, and English,
and Spaniards, and Italians, and Scandinavians. Pretty much everyone who isn’t
us.”</p>

<p>“Which is why your father is always
shouting.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Jacob laughed. “And
by the way, the sign for stingy is the same as the sign for Jew, just with a
clenched fist at the end.”</p>

<p>“Jesus.”</p>

<p>Jacob held his straightened arms
out to his sides and tilted his head toward his right shoulder. Julia laughed
and squeezed the sponge until her knuckles went white.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know what to say,
Jacob. I can’t believe that you’ve kept an entire language secret.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t keeping it secret. I just
didn’t tell anyone.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“When I write my memoir, I’m going
to call it ‘The Big Book of Whys.’”</p>

<p>“People hearing that title might
think it’s w-i-s-e.”</p>

<p>“Let them think.”</p>

<p>“And I thought you were calling it
‘The Bible.’”</p>

<p>Julia turned off the radio, which
had been broadcasting at no volume for who knows how long. “Different countries
have different sign languages, right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So what’s the Jewish sign for
Jew?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea,” Jacob said. He
picked up his phone and googled “Hebrew Sign Language for Jew.” He turned his
phone toward Julia and said, “It’s the same.”</p>

<p>“That’s sad.”</p>

<p>“It is, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“On a few levels.”</p>

<p>“What would you make it?” Jacob
asked.</p>

<p>“A Star of David would require some
serious double-jointedness.”</p>

<p>“Maybe a palm on the top of the
head?”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” Julia said, “but it
doesn’t account for women. Or the great majority of Jewish men, like you, who
don’t wear yarmulkes. Maybe palms open like a book?”</p>

<p>“Very nice,” Jacob said, “but are
illiterate Jews not Jews? Are babies?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking that it was
reading a book, but the book itself. The Torah, maybe. Or the Book of Life. How
do you sign life?”</p>

<p>“Remember from Life is long?” he
said, once again making his hands into guns, and then moving the forefingers up
his torso.</p>

<p>“So like this,” Julia said, putting
her hands in front of her, unpeeling them like a book, and then moving those
upturned palms up her torso, as if pushing a book through her lungs.</p>

<p>“I’ll run it up the flagpole next
time the Elders of Zion convene.”</p>

<p>“What’s the sign for gentile?”</p>

<p>“Gentile? Who fucking cares?”</p>

<p>Julia laughed, and Jacob laughed.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you knew a
language all alone.”</p>

<p>Eliezer Ben-Yehuda single-handedly
revived Hebrew. Unlike most Zionists, he wasn’t passionate about the creation
of the State of Israel so that his people would have a home. He wanted his
language to have a home. He knew that without a state—without a place for Jews
to haggle, and curse, and create secular laws, and make love—the language
wouldn’t survive. And without a language, there wouldn’t ultimately be a
people.</p>

<p>Ben-Yehuda’s son, Itamar, was the
first native speaker of Hebrew in more than a thousand years. He was raised
forbidden to hear or speak any other language. (His father once berated
Itamar’s mother for singing a Russian lullaby.) His parents wouldn’t allow him
to play with other children—none of them spoke Hebrew—but as a concession to
his loneliness they gave him a dog with the name Maher, meaning “fast” in
Hebrew. It was a kind of child abuse. And yet it is possible that he is even
more responsible than his father for the first time a modern Jew ever told a
dirty joke in Hebrew, ever told another Jew to fuck off in Hebrew, ever typed
Hebrew into a court stenography machine, ever shouted unmeant words in Hebrew,
ever, in Hebrew, moaned in pleasure.</p>

<p>Jacob put the last dried mugs back
on the shelf upside down.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>“I’m doing it your way.”</p>

<p>“And you’re not hysterically
concerned about their ability to dry without proper circulation?”</p>

<p>“No, but neither am I suddenly
convinced they’re going to fill with dust. I’m just tired of disagreeing.”</p>

<p>God instructed Moses to put both
the intact tablets and the broken tablets in the ark. The Jews carried them—the
broken and the whole—for their forty years of wandering, and placed them both
in the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Why? Why didn’t they just bury
them, as would befit a sacred text? Or leave them behind, as would befit a
blasphemy?</p>

<p>Because they were ours.</p>

<h1>VII. THE BIBLE</h1>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY SADNESS</p>

<p>It doesn’t exist, so hide it like a
tumor.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY FEAR</p>

<p>For a laugh.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY CRYING</p>

<p>At my grandfather’s funeral, the
rabbi told the story of Moses being discovered by Pharaoh’s daughter. “Look!”
she said after opening the basket. “A crying Hebrew baby.” He asked the kids to
try to explain what Pharaoh’s daughter said. Benjy suggested that Moses was
“crying in Jewish.”</p>

<p>The rabbi asked, “What would it
sound like to cry in Jewish?”</p>

<p>Max took a step forward, toward the
unfilled grave, and said, “Maybe like laughing?”</p>

<p>I took a step back.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY LATE LAUGHTER</p>

<p>Use humor as aggressively as chemo.
Laugh until your hair falls out. There is nothing that can’t be played for a
laugh. When Julia says, “It’s just the two of us. Just you and me on the
phone,” laugh and say, “And God. And the NSA.”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY THE DEATH OF HAIR</p>

<p>No one has any idea how much hair
he has—both because our hair can’t be fully seen with our eyes (not even with
multiple mirrors, believe me) and because our eyes are our own.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when they were still
young enough not to question the question—and could be trusted not to mention
it to others—I would ask the boys how bald I was. I’d bow to them, adjust my
hair to reveal where I thought it was thinning, and ask them to describe me to
me.</p>

<p>“Looks normal,” they’d usually say.</p>

<p>“What about here?”</p>

<p>“Pretty much the same as everyone
else.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t seem like there’s
less right here?”</p>

<p>“Not really.”</p>

<p>“Not really? Or no?”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“I’m asking for your help here.
Could you give it a real look and then give me a real answer?”</p>

<p>What there was of my hair was a
prop, the product of pharmaceutical intervention—the tiny hands of Aaron and
Hur clutching my roots from inside my skull. I blamed my balding on genetics,
and I blamed it on stress. In that way, it was no different from anything else.</p>

<p>The Propecia worked by suppressing
testosterone. One of the well-documented and widely experienced side effects is
decreased libido. That’s a fact, not an opinion or defense. I wish I could have
shared it with Julia. But I couldn’t, because I couldn’t let her know about the
Propecia, because I couldn’t admit that I cared how I looked. Better to let her
think she couldn’t make me hard.</p>

<p>I was taking a bath with Benjy a
few months after the kids had started spending time at my house. We were
talking about The Odyssey, a children’s version of which we had recently
finished, and how painful it must have been for Odysseus to keep his identity
secret after finally making it home, but why it was necessary.</p>

<p>“It’s not enough just to get home,”
he said. “You have to be able to stay there.”</p>

<p>I said, “You’re so right, Benjy.” I
always used his name when I was proud of him.</p>

<p>“You actually are kind of bald,” he
said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You’re kind of bald.”</p>

<p>“I am?”</p>

<p>“Kind of, yeah.”</p>

<p>“Have you been trying to protect my
feelings all this time?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Where am I bald?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Touch the parts that are bald.”</p>

<p>I bowed to him, but felt no touch.</p>

<p>“Benjy?” I asked, facing the water.</p>

<p>“You’re not bald.”</p>

<p>I lifted my head. “Then why’d you
say it?”</p>

<p>“Because I wanted to make you feel
good.”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY TRUE BALDNESS</p>

<p>We used to go to Great Wall
Szechuan House every Christmas, the five of us. We held the kids up to the
aquarium until our arms trembled, and ordered every hot appetizer that didn’t
involve pork. The last such Christmas, my fortune was “You are not a ghost.”
When we read them aloud, as was the ritual, I looked at “You are not a ghost”
and said, “There is always a way.”</p>

<p>A dozen years later, I lost all my
hair in the course of a month. Benjy showed up unexpectedly that Christmas Eve
with enough Chinese food for a family of five.</p>

<p>“You got one of everything?” I
asked, laughing out my love of the wonderfully ridiculous abundance.</p>

<p>“One of everything treyf,” he said.</p>

<p>“Are you worried that I’m lonely?”</p>

<p>“Are you worried that I’m worried?”</p>

<p>We ate on the sofa, plates on our
laps, the coffee table covered with steaming white boxes. Before refilling,
Benjy put his empty plate on the crowded table, took my head between his hands,
and angled it down. If it had been any less unexpected, I would have found a
way out. But once it was happening, I gave myself over: rested my hands on my
knees, closed my eyes.</p>

<p>“You don’t have enough hands,
right?”</p>

<p>“I don’t need any.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Benjy.”</p>

<p>“I’m serious,” he said. “Full head
of hair.”</p>

<p>“The doctor warned me, however many
years ago, that this would happen: as soon as you stop taking the pill, you
lose it all at once. I didn’t believe him. Or I thought I’d be the exception.”</p>

<p>“How does it feel?”</p>

<p>“Being able to slice bread with an
erection?”</p>

<p>“I’m eating, Dad.”</p>

<p>“Being able to do push-ups with my
hands behind my back?”</p>

<p>“Sorry I expressed interest,” he
said, unable to pin the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>“You know, I needed an egg once.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” he asked, playing along.</p>

<p>“Yeah. I was doing some baking—”</p>

<p>“You often bake.”</p>

<p>“All the time. I’m surprised I’m
not baking as I tell this joke. Anyway, I was doing some baking, and found that
I was one egg short. Isn’t that the worst?”</p>

<p>“There is literally nothing worse.”</p>

<p>“Right?” We were both starting to
simmer in anticipation. “So rather than schlep to the store through the snow to
buy eleven eggs I didn’t want, I thought I’d see if I could borrow one.”</p>

<p>“And that, right there, is why the
1998 National Jewish Book Award hangs in your office.”</p>

<p>“Yiddishe kop,” I said, tapping my
forehead.</p>

<p>“I wish you were my real dad,”
Benjy said, his eyes moistening with suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>“So I opened the window—” I wasn’t
sure I’d make it to the punch line that was still forming as I approached it.
“So I opened the window, wrote, directed, and starred in a five-second fantasy
for which there aren’t enough Xs, and my tumescent glans rang the doorbell of
the neighbor across the street.”</p>

<p>Almost convulsing with restraint,
Benjy asked, “Did she have an egg?”</p>

<p>“He.”</p>

<p>“He!”</p>

<p>“And no, he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“What an asshole.”</p>

<p>“And I accidentally blinded him.”</p>

<p>“Injury to the insult.”</p>

<p>“No, wait. Wait. Do it again. Ask
me if she had an egg.”</p>

<p>“I have a question.”</p>

<p>“Let me try to answer it.”</p>

<p>“Did she have an egg?”</p>

<p>“Your mom? She did.”</p>

<p>“Wonder of wonders!”</p>

<p>“And I accidentally fertilized it.”</p>

<p>The laughter we’d been containing
never came. We sighed, smiled, sat back, and nodded for no reason. Benjy said,
“It must be a relief.”</p>

<p>“What must?”</p>

<p>“Finally looking like yourself.”</p>

<p>I looked at “You will travel to
many places” and said, “I am not a ghost.”</p>

<p>Benjy was five when we started
Tales from the Odyssey. I’d read it to Sam and Max, and both times, the further
we got in, the slower we read, until we were making it through only a page a
night. Benjy and I got all the way through the Cyclops that first bedtime. I
had a rare instance of recognizing what was happening as it happened—he was my
final child, and this was my final reading of the passage. It would not last.
“‘Why?’” I read. “‘Why do you break the stillness of the night with your
cries?’” I gave space to each pause, opening the sentences as far as they would
go. “‘Who harms you?’ ‘NO ONE!’ Polyphemus shouted, writhing on the floor of
his cave. ‘No One tried to kill me! No One blinded me!’”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY NO ONE</p>

<p>I told Julia I didn’t want her to
go with us to the airport. I would tuck in the children, like any other night,
no overly dramatic goodbyes, let them know I’d FaceTime as often as possible
and be back in a week or two with a suitcase of tchotchkes. And then I’d leave
while they slept.</p>

<p>“You can do it however you want,”
she said. “But can I ask you—or can you ask yourself—what it is you’re waiting
for?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Everything is no big deal. You’ve
raised your voice once in your entire life, to tell me I was your enemy.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that.”</p>

<p>“I know. But you don’t mean the
silence, either. If this isn’t a big deal—saying goodbye to your children
before going to war—what is? What is the big deal you’re waiting for?”</p>

<p>My father drove us to MacArthur
Airport in Islip, Long Island. I sat in the passenger seat, and Barak moved in
and out of sleep against Tamir’s chest in the back. Five hours. On the radio,
there was coverage of the first day of Operation Arms of Moses. Reporters were
stationed at the designated airfields around the world, but as it was still
early, most of the reporting was just speculation about how many would heed the
call. It was the opposite of the ride we’d made only a few weeks earlier, from
Washington National to the house.</p>

<p>What conversations there were in
the car were segregated front and back; I could hear little of what passed
between Tamir and Barak, and my father, who lacked an indoor voice, found his
whisper.</p>

<p>“Gabe Perelman will be there,” he
said. “I spoke to Hersch last night. We’re going to see a lot of people we
know.”</p>

<p>“Probably.”</p>

<p>“Glenn Mechling. Larry Moverman.”</p>

<p>“Mom’s OK, right? She was
worryingly nonchalant this morning.”</p>

<p>“She’s a mother. But she’ll be fine.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“What can I say? The price of
speaking unpopular truths. I turned the ringer off on the home phone. And
D.C.’s finest put a car on the corner. I told them not to. They insisted, told
me it wasn’t my choice. It’ll pass.”</p>

<p>“Not that. I mean with me going.”</p>

<p>“You read what I wrote. Every part
of me wishes you didn’t have to go, but I know you do.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe this is
happening.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you haven’t been
listening to me for the past twenty years.”</p>

<p>“Longer than that.”</p>

<p>Eyes on the road, he rested his
right hand on my thigh and said, “I can’t believe it, either.”</p>

<p>We stopped curbside. The airport
was closed, save for flights to Israel. There were about two dozen cars
unloading men, and no one waving a stumpy lightsaber and saying, “Keep it
moving, keep it moving,” but there were two men in army green with machine guns
pressed to their chests.</p>

<p>We took our duffels from the trunk
and stood by the car.</p>

<p>“Barak’s not going to get out?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“He’s asleep,” Tamir said. “We said
goodbye in the car. It’s better this way.”</p>

<p>My father put his hand on Tamir’s
shoulder and told him, “You’re brave.”</p>

<p>Tamir said, “This doesn’t count as
bravery.”</p>

<p>“I loved your father.”</p>

<p>“He loved you.”</p>

<p>My father nodded. He put his other
hand on Tamir’s other shoulder and said, “Since he’s no longer here—” and that
was all that was needed. As if the knowledge of what to do at that moment had
been coiled into him at birth, Tamir put down his duffel, let his arms rest at
his sides, and bowed slightly. My father placed his hands atop Tamir’s head and
said, “Y’varech’cha Adonai v’yishm’recha. May God bless you and guard you.
Ya’ar Adonai panav ay’lecha viy’hunecha. May God make His face shine upon you
and be gracious unto you. Yisa Adonai panav ay’lecha v’yasaym l’cha shalom. May
God turn His face unto you and grant you peace.”</p>

<p>Tamir thanked my father and told me
he’d go for a walk, then meet me inside.</p>

<p>Once it was just the two of us, my
father laughed.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>He said, “You know what Lou
Gehrig’s final words were, right?”</p>

<p>“‘I don’t want to die’?”</p>

<p>“‘Damn, Lou Gehrig’s disease, I
should have seen that coming.’”</p>

<p>“Funny.”</p>

<p>“We should have seen this coming,”
he said.</p>

<p>“You did.”</p>

<p>“No, I just said I did.”</p>

<p>Barak rose from his sleep, calmly
looked around, and then, perhaps assuming he was in a dream, closed his eyes
and rested his forehead against the window.</p>

<p>“You’ll go to the house every day,
right?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” my father said.</p>

<p>“And take the kids out. Give Julia
a break every now and then.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Make sure Mom eats.”</p>

<p>“You’ve traded places.”</p>

<p>“A friend at the Times said it’s
nowhere near as bad as it sounds. Israel is intentionally making the situation
appear worse than it is with the hopes of getting more American support. He
said they’re drawing it out to achieve the most propitious peace.”</p>

<p>“The Times is an anti-Semitic pap
smear.”</p>

<p>“I’m just saying don’t be scared.”</p>

<p>As if the knowledge of what to do
at that moment had been coiled into me at birth, I bowed. My father put his
hands atop my head. I waited. As if the knowledge of what to do at that moment
had been coiled into him at my birth, his palms began to close, taking my hair
into the grip of his fingers, holding me in place. I waited for a blessing that
would never come.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY SILENCE</p>

<p>First ask, “What kind of silence is
this?” EMBARRASSED SILENCE is not ASHAMED SILENCE. WORDLESS SILENCE is not
SPEECHLESS SILENCE, is not SILENCE OF SUBTLE WITHHOLDING. And so on. And on and
on.</p>

<p>Then ask, “What kind of suicide or
sacrifice is this?”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY RAISED VOICES</p>

<p>I’ve raised my voice to a human
only twice in my entire life. The first time was when Julia confronted me with
the texts and, pushed beyond my self-control, into my self, I shouted: “You are
my enemy!” She didn’t remember that she had given me that line. When she was in
labor with Sam—her only natural childbirth—she traced a forty-hour spiral into
deeper and more isolating pain, until, surrounded by the same four walls, we
were in different rooms. The doula said something absurd (something that, at
any other moment, Julia would have dismissed with a roll of her eyes), and I
said something loving (something that, at any other moment, Julia would have
teared up about and thanked me for), and Julia moaned like a nonfemale
nonhuman, grabbed the bed rail like it was a roller-coaster safety bar, looked
at me with eyes more satanic than in any red-pupilled photograph, and snarled,
“You are my enemy!” I hadn’t meant to quote her thirteen years later, and it
didn’t even occur to me that I’d done so until I wrote about it after. Like so
much that happened during labor, Julia seemed to have no memory of it.</p>

<p>The second time I raised my voice
at a human was also at Julia, many years later. I found it so much easier to
give what wasn’t asked for or owed. Maybe I learned that from Argus—the only
way to get him to drop a fetched ball was to appear indifferent. Maybe Argus
learned that from me. Once Julia and I were living separate lives, it was not
only possible to push my inner life through our still-shared conduit, I longed
to. Because she appeared indifferent to it—appeared, or was.</p>

<p>Julia and I hadn’t spoken in a long
time, but she was the person I wanted to talk to. I called, she answered, we
shared, just like old times weren’t. I said, “I guess I wanted proof.” She
said, “I’m the gentle soul you called, remember?” I said, “Remember how they
say the world is uniquely open?” She asked, “What happened to you?” She wasn’t
accusing or challenging me. She said it with the indifference necessary for me
to give everything.</p>

<p>I’ve raised my voice at a human
only twice in my entire life. Both times at the same human. Put differently:
I’ve known only one human in my life. Put differently: I’ve allowed only one
human to know me.</p>

<p>In a sadness beyond anger, pain,
and fear, I screamed at Julia: “Unfair! Unfair! Unfair!”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY THE DEATH OF LANGUAGE</p>

<p>In the synagogue of my youth—which
I left when I went to college and rejoined when Julia became pregnant with
Sam—there was a memorial wall with tiny bulbs lit next to the names of those
who had died in the given week of the year. As a boy, I rearranged the plastic
letters that formed the names into whatever words I could. My father used to
tell me that there were no bad words, only bad usage. And then, when I became a
father, I told my boys the same thing.</p>

<p>There were more than fourteen
hundred congregants of fighting age. Of the sixty-two who went to fight in
Israel, twenty-four died. Two ten-watt, candelabra-base, flame-tip bulbs for
each name. Only 480 watts of light. Fewer than in my living room chandelier. No
one touched those names. But one day they will be rearranged into words. Or so
is the hope.</p>

<p>It feels like it’s been centuries
since I wandered that building. But I can remember the smells: the siddurim
like withered flowers, the must of the basket of yarmulkes, the new-car smell
of the ark. And I can remember the surfaces: where the broad strips of linen
wallpaper met; the Braille-like plaques affixed to the armrests of every velvet
chair, immortalizing the largesse of someone unlikely ever to sit there; the
cold steel banister of the plush-carpeted stairs. I can remember the heat of
those bulbs, and the roughness of the letters. As I sit at a desk filled with
thousands of pages, continuing to comment on the commentary, I wonder how one
should judge the usage of words made from the dead. And the living. From
everyone living and dead.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY NO ONE</p>

<p>There were several hundred men in
the waiting area. Several hundred Jewish men. We were circumcised men, men who
shared Jewish genetic markers, men who hummed the same ancient melodies. How
many times, as a child, was I told that it didn’t matter whether or not I
thought of myself as Jewish, the Germans thought of me as a Jew? In the holding
area of that airport, perhaps for the first time in my life, I stopped wondering
if I felt Jewish. Not because I had an answer, but because the question stopped
mattering.</p>

<p>I saw a few people I knew: old
friends, familiar faces from the synagogue, some public figures. I didn’t see
Gabe Perelman or Larry Moverman, but Glenn Mechling was there. We nodded at
each other across the enormous room. There was little interacting. Some sat in
silence, or talked on their cell phones—presumably to their families. There
were outbursts of singing: “Yerushalayim Shel Zachav” … “Hatikva” … It was emotional,
but what was the it? The camaraderie? The most extreme version of the
recognition I felt with the deaf father at the convention? The shared devotion?
The sudden awareness of history, how small and big it is, how impotent and
omnipotent an individual is inside it? The fear?</p>

<p>I had written books and screenplays
my entire adult life, but it was the first time I’d felt like a character
inside one—that the scale of my tchotchke existence, the drama of living,
finally befitted the privilege of being alive.</p>

<p>No, it was the second time. The
first time was in the lion’s den.</p>

<p>Tamir was right: my problems were
small. I’d spent so much of my finite time on earth thinking small thoughts,
feeling small feelings, walking under doors into unoccupied rooms. How many hours
did I spend online, rewatching inane videos, scrutinizing listings for houses I
would never buy, clicking over to check for hasty e-mails from people I didn’t
care about? How much of myself, how many words, feelings, and actions, had I
forcefully contained? I’d angled myself away from myself, by a fraction of a
degree, but after so many years, finding my way back to myself required a
plane.</p>

<p>They were singing, and I knew the
song, but not how to join them.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY THE ITCH OF HOPE</p>

<p>I always believed that all it would
take to completely change my life would be a complete change of personhood.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY HOME</p>

<p>The completion of Tales from the
Odyssey left Max bereft.</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked, spinning to face
his pillow. “Why did it have to end?”</p>

<p>I rubbed his back, told him, “But
you wouldn’t want Odysseus wandering forever, would you?”</p>

<p>“Well, then why did he have to
leave home at all?”</p>

<p>The next morning, I took him to the
farmer’s market with the hope of finding some consolation in baked goods. Every
other Sunday, a mobile pet rescue stationed itself by the main entrance, and
we’d often stop and admire the animals. Max was drawn that morning to a golden
retriever named Stan. We’d never spoken about getting a dog, and I certainly
hadn’t intended to get a dog, and I don’t even know if he wanted that
particular dog, but I told him, “If you would like to take Stan home, we can.”</p>

<p>Everyone but me bounded into the
house. Julia was furious, but didn’t show it until we were alone at the top of
the stairs. She said, “Again, you’ve put me in the position of either having to
go along with a bad idea or be the bad guy.”</p>

<p>Downstairs, the boys were calling:
“Stan! Here, Stan! Come on, now!”</p>

<p>I had asked the woman running the
pet rescue how he got the name Stan—it struck me as an odd choice for a dog.
She said the dogs were given retired names of Atlantic storms. With so many
dogs moving through the facility, it made things easy simply to use a list.</p>

<p>“Sorry, a retired name of what?”</p>

<p>“You know how storms get names? There’s
something like a hundred that are cycled through. But if a storm is especially
costly or deadly, they retire the name—to be sensitive. There will never be
another Sandy.”</p>

<p>Just as there will never be another
Isaac.</p>

<p>We don’t know the name of my grandfather’s
grandfather.</p>

<p>When my grandfather came to
America, he changed his name from Blumenberg to Bloch.</p>

<p>My father was the first person in
our family to have an “English name” and a “Hebrew name.”</p>

<p>When I became a writer, I
experimented with different versions of my name: various uses of initials, the
insertion of my middle name, pseudonyms.</p>

<p>The farther we got from Europe, the
more identities we had to choose between.</p>

<p>“No One tried to kill me! No One
blinded me!”</p>

<p>It was Max’s idea to rename Stan. I
said it might confuse him. Max said, “But we need to make him ours.”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY NO ONE</p>

<p>We were given some simple forms to
fill out, and an announcement was made that we were to pass, single file, in
front of a middle-aged man in a white lab coat. He gave each person a quick
visual inspection and pointed toward one of about a dozen long lines, which
began to roughly correspond to age. The resonance with the selections upon
entering the concentration camps was so explicit and undeniable, it was hard to
imagine it wasn’t intentional.</p>

<p>When I reached the front of my
line, a stocky woman, perhaps seventy, invited me to sit opposite her at a
plastic folding table. She took my papers and started filling out a series of
forms.</p>

<p>“Atah medaber ivrit?” she asked
without looking up.</p>

<p>“Sorry?”</p>

<p>“Lo medaber ivrit,” she said,
checking a box.</p>

<p>“Sorry?”</p>

<p>“Jewish?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Recite the Sh’ma.”</p>

<p>“Sh’ma Yisrael, Adonai—”</p>

<p>“Do you belong to a Jewish
community?”</p>

<p>“Adas Israel.”</p>

<p>“How often do you attend services?”</p>

<p>“Maybe twice a year, every other
year?”</p>

<p>“What are the two occasions?”</p>

<p>“Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.”</p>

<p>“Any languages besides English?”</p>

<p>“A little Spanish.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that will be very useful.
Health conditions?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“No asthma? High blood pressure?
Epilepsy?”</p>

<p>“No. I do have some eczema. At the
back of my hairline.”</p>

<p>“Have you tried coconut oil?” she
asked, still not looking up.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“So try it. Military training or
experience?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever fired a gun?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never held a gun.”</p>

<p>She checked a number of boxes,
apparently feeling no need to ask the next sequence of questions.</p>

<p>“Can you function without your
glasses?”</p>

<p>“Function highly?”</p>

<p>She checked a box.</p>

<p>“Can you swim?”</p>

<p>“Without my glasses?”</p>

<p>“Do you know how to swim?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been a competitive
swimmer?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you have any experience with
knot tying?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t everyone?”</p>

<p>She checked two boxes.</p>

<p>“Can you read a topographical map?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I know what I’m looking
at, but I don’t know if that qualifies as reading.”</p>

<p>She checked a box.</p>

<p>“Do you have any experience with
electrical engineering?”</p>

<p>“I once took a—”</p>

<p>“You cannot disarm a simple bomb.”</p>

<p>“I mean, how simple?”</p>

<p>“You cannot disarm a simple bomb.”</p>

<p>“I cannot.”</p>

<p>“What’s the longest you’ve ever
gone without eating?”</p>

<p>“Yom Kippur, a while ago.”</p>

<p>“What is your tolerance for pain?”</p>

<p>“I don’t even know how one would
answer that question.”</p>

<p>“You answered the question,” she
said. “Have you ever been in shock?”</p>

<p>“Probably. In fact, yes. Often.”</p>

<p>“Are you claustrophobic?”</p>

<p>“Hugely.”</p>

<p>“What is the greatest load you can
carry?”</p>

<p>“Physically?”</p>

<p>“Are you sensitive to extremes of
heat or cold?”</p>

<p>“Is anyone not?”</p>

<p>“Allergic to medications?”</p>

<p>“I’m lactose intolerant, but I
guess that’s not really what you were asking.”</p>

<p>“Morphine?”</p>

<p>“Morphine?”</p>

<p>“Do you know first aid?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t answer about morphine.”</p>

<p>“Are you allergic to morphine?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea.”</p>

<p>She wrote something down, which I
tried, without success, to decipher.</p>

<p>“I don’t want not to get morphine
if I need morphine.”</p>

<p>“There are other forms of pain
relief.”</p>

<p>“Are they as good?”</p>

<p>“Do you know first aid?”</p>

<p>“Sort of.”</p>

<p>“That will sort of be a comfort to
someone sort of in need of first aid.”</p>

<p>While perusing the paperwork I’d
filled out in line, she said, “Emergency contact information…”</p>

<p>“It’s there.”</p>

<p>“Julia Bloch.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“She’s who?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t fill in your
relationship.”</p>

<p>“Sure I did.”</p>

<p>“So you used invisible ink on that
one.”</p>

<p>“She’s my wife.”</p>

<p>“Most wives prefer permanent
marker.”</p>

<p>“I must have—”</p>

<p>“You are an organ donor in
America.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“If you are killed in Israel, would
you allow your organs to be used in Israel?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, allowing the s to
skid for a hundred feet.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I’m killed—”</p>

<p>“What is your blood type?”</p>

<p>“Blood type?”</p>

<p>“You have blood?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“What type? A? B? AB? O?”</p>

<p>“You’re asking for giving, or
receiving?”</p>

<p>Finally, for the first time since
we started speaking, she looked me in the eye. “It’s the same blood.”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY SUICIDE GROWTH RINGS</p>

<p>For left-handedness, or twins, or
red hair, to run in one’s family—as all of those do in mine—there need to be
multiple occurrences. For suicide to run in one’s family, there needs to be
only one.</p>

<p>I received my grandfather’s death
certificate from the Maryland Department of Records. I wanted to know that I
knew what I already knew. The coroner’s handwriting was as good as typeset, the
opposite of a doctor’s: asphyxiation by hanging. He killed himself at
approximately ten in the morning. The certificate said that it was Mr.
Kowalski, the next-door neighbor, who made the report. That my grandfather’s
name was Isaac Bloch. That he had been born in Poland. That he hanged himself
with a belt wedged between his kitchen door and its frame.</p>

<p>But when I was imagining it in bed
that night, I saw him outside, hanging by a rope from a tree. The grass in the
shadow of his feet slowly died and powdered to a little patch of dirt in an
otherwise wild, overgrown garden.</p>

<p>Later in the night, I imagined
plants ascending to meet his feet, as if the earth were trying to atone for its
gravity. I imagined palm fronds holding him up like hands, the rope slack.</p>

<p>Even later—I barely slept—I
imagined walking with my grandfather through a redwood forest. His skin was
blue and his fingernails were an inch long, but otherwise he looked like the
man at whose kitchen table I used to eat black bread and cantaloupe, the man
who, when told not to change into his bathing suit in public, asked, “Why not?”
He stopped at a massive overturned tree and pointed at the rings.</p>

<p>“This, here, is my parents’
wedding. It was an arranged marriage. It worked. And here,” he said, pointing
at a different ring, “is when Iser fell from a tree and broke his arm.”</p>

<p>“Iser?”</p>

<p>“My brother. You were named for
him.”</p>

<p>“I thought I was named for someone
named Yakov.”</p>

<p>“No. We just told you that.”</p>

<p>“How does Iser become Jacob?”</p>

<p>“Iser is short for Israel. After
wrestling with Jacob through the night, the angel renamed him Israel.”</p>

<p>“How old was he?”</p>

<p>“And here,” he said, pointing at
another ring, “is when I left home. With Benny. Everyone else stayed—my
grandparents and parents, my other five brothers—and I wanted to stay, but
Benny convinced me. He forced me. And here is when Benny and I got on different
boats, one for America, one for Israel.” He touched a ring, and let his long
fingernail slide outward toward the bark as he spoke. “This, here, is when you
were born. Here you were a boy. Here you got married. Here is Sam’s birth, here
is Max’s, here is Benjy’s. And here”—he touched his fingernail to the rim of
the trunk, like a record needle—“is right now. And out here”—he pointed to a
spot in the air, about an inch outside the trunk—“is when you’ll die, and
here”—he gestured at the area slightly nearer to the trunk—“is the rest of your
life, and here”—he pointed to just outside the trunk—“is what happens next.”</p>

<p>I understood, somehow, that the
weight of his hanging body had pulled the tree over, making our history
visible.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY SEVEN RINGS</p>

<p>I could never anticipate which
religious rituals Julia would find beautiful and which misogynistic, morally
repugnant, or simply foolish. So I was surprised when she wanted to walk the
seven rings around me under the chuppah.</p>

<p>In our preparatory reading—her
preparatory reading; I gave up fairly quickly—she learned that the rings echo
the biblical story of Joshua leading the Israelites into Canaan. When they came
to the walled city of Jericho, and the first battle they would have to fight on
their way to the Promised Land, God instructed Joshua to march the Israelites
around the walls seven times. As soon as they had completed the seventh ring,
the walls came tumbling down, and the Israelites conquered the city.</p>

<p>“You hide your greatest secret
behind a wall,” she said, with a tone that suggested both irony and
earnestness, “and I will surround you with love, and the wall will topple—”</p>

<p>“And you will have conquered me.”</p>

<p>“We will have conquered ourselves.”</p>

<p>“All I have to do is stand there?”</p>

<p>“Just stand there and topple.”</p>

<p>“What’s my greatest secret?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We’re only
beginning.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t until we were ending that
she knew.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY THE LAST WHOLLY HAPPY MOMENT</p>

<p>“Let’s do something special,” I
suggested a month before Julia’s fortieth birthday. “Something unlike us. A
party. A blowout: band, ice cream truck, magician.”</p>

<p>“A magician?”</p>

<p>“Or a flamenco dancer.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “That’s the last
thing I’d want.”</p>

<p>“Even if it’s last, it’s still on
the list.”</p>

<p>She laughed and said, “It’s sweet
of you to think of that. But let’s do something simple. A nice dinner at home.”</p>

<p>“Come on. We’ll make it fun.”</p>

<p>“Fun for me would be a simple
family dinner.”</p>

<p>I tried a few times to persuade
her, but she made clear, with increasing force, that she didn’t want “a big
deal.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you’re not protesting
too much?”</p>

<p>“I’m not protesting at all. The
thing I most want is to have a nice, quiet dinner with my family.”</p>

<p>The boys and I made her breakfast
in bed that morning: fresh waffle, kale-and-pear smoothie, huevos rancheros.</p>

<p>We whispered wishes to the elephant
at the zoo (an old birthday ritual, origin unknown), collected leaves in Rock
Creek Park for pressing into the Book of Years (another ritual), ate lunch at
one of the outside tables of her favorite Greek restaurant in Dupont Circle. We
went to the Phillips Collection, where Sam and Max feigned interest so
earnestly and poorly, Julia was moved to tell them, “I know you love me. It’s
OK to be bored.”</p>

<p>It was getting dark when we made it
home, with half a dozen bags of groceries for dinner supplies. (I insisted that
we not shop for any other meals, even though there were things we needed.
“Today,” I said, “will not be utilitarian.”) I gave Sam the key, and the boys
ran ahead into the house. Julia and I unloaded the bags on the island and
started putting away the perishables. Our eyes met, and I saw that she was
crying.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You’re going to hate me if I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I won’t.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be extremely annoyed.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure there’s an
annoyance moratorium on birthdays.”</p>

<p>And then, really letting the tears
come, she said, “I actually wanted a big deal.”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s not funny.”</p>

<p>“It is funny, Julia.”</p>

<p>“It’s not that I knew what I wanted
and hid it from you. I wasn’t trying to be disappointed.”</p>

<p>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“I meant what I said at the time. I
really did. It wasn’t until right now—not even when we entered the house, but
right this second—that I realized I really wanted a big deal. I did. It’s so
stupid. What am I, eight?”</p>

<p>“You’re forty.”</p>

<p>“I am, aren’t I? I’m a
forty-year-old who doesn’t know herself until it’s too late. And to make
matters worse, I’m dumping it on you, as if you could respond with anything
other than guilt or hurt.”</p>

<p>“Here,” I said, handing her a box
of orecchiette. “Put these away.”</p>

<p>“That’s as far as your sympathy can
reach?”</p>

<p>“What happened to the annoyance
moratorium?”</p>

<p>“That’s a one-way street, and you
know it.”</p>

<p>“Put the pretentious pasta away.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “No. Today, I
won’t.”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s not funny,” she said, banging
the counter.</p>

<p>“It’s so funny,” I said.</p>

<p>She grabbed the box, ripped off the
top, and poured the pasta on the floor.</p>

<p>“I made a huge mess,” she said,
“and I don’t even know why.”</p>

<p>I told her, “Put the empty box
away.”</p>

<p>“The box?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked. “To create a
depressing symbol?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “because
understanding oneself isn’t a prerequisite for being understood.”</p>

<p>She inhaled, understanding
something she didn’t yet understand, and opened the pantry door. Out spilled
the boys, and the grandparents, and Mark and Jennifer, and David and Hannah,
and Steve and Patty, and someone turned the music on, and it was Stevie Wonder,
and someone released the balloons from the hall closet, and they jangled the
chandelier, and Julia looked at me.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY EXISTENTIAL SHAME</p>

<p>The IKEA encounter with Maggie
Silliman haunted me for years. She was the embodiment of my shame. I would
often wake in the middle of the night and write letters to her. Each began the
same way: “You were wrong. I am not a good man.” If I could have been the
embodiment of my shame, I might have been spared it. I might even have been
good.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY UNBROKEN RINGS</p>

<p>For his first trick, the magician
asked Julia to pull a card from an invisible deck.</p>

<p>“Look at it,” he said, “but don’t
let me see it.”</p>

<p>With a roll of her eyes, she
obeyed.</p>

<p>“You know your card?”</p>

<p>She nodded and said, “Yeah. I know
my card.”</p>

<p>“Now please throw it across the
room.”</p>

<p>With an overdramatized windup, she
hurled the invisible card. The gesture was beautiful to watch: the fakeness of
it, the generosity of its spirit, how quick it was and how long it took, the
movement of her ring through the air.</p>

<p>“Max. Your name is Max, right? Can
you go fetch the card your mother just threw?”</p>

<p>“But it’s invisible,” he said,
looking to his mother for help.</p>

<p>“Get it anyway,” the magician said,
and Julia nodded permission.</p>

<p>So Max happily waddled across the
room.</p>

<p>“OK, got it!” he said.</p>

<p>“And could you please tell us what
the card is.”</p>

<p>Max looked to his mother and said,
“But I can’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Tell us, anyway,” the magician
said.</p>

<p>“And I can’t remember what the
different kinds of cards are.”</p>

<p>“Hearts, spades, clubs, and
diamonds. Any number two through ten. Or joker, jack, queen, king, or ace.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Max said, and again looked
to his mother, who again let him know it was OK. He examined the invisible
card, held it right up to his squinting eyes. “It’s a seven of diamonds.”</p>

<p>The magician didn’t have to ask
Julia if that was her card, because she was crying. Nodding and crying.</p>

<p>We ate some cake, we cleared out
the dining room and did some silly dancing, we used paper plates and disposable
cutlery.</p>

<p>The magician stuck around for a
while, doing close-up magic for whoever would pay attention.</p>

<p>“That was really great,” I told
him, patting him on the back, surprised and repelled by his skinniness. “Just
perfect.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad. Feel free to recommend
me. It’s how I get my jobs.”</p>

<p>“I certainly will.”</p>

<p>He did the classic linked-rings
trick for me. I’d seen it countless times, but it was still a thrill.</p>

<p>“My dad was the magician at my
fifth birthday,” I told him. “He opened with that.”</p>

<p>“So you know how it’s done?”</p>

<p>“Broken rings.”</p>

<p>He handed them to me. I must have
spent five full minutes searching for what had to be there.</p>

<p>“What happens if the trick goes
wrong?” I asked, not yet ready to return the rings.</p>

<p>“How would it go wrong?”</p>

<p>“Someone takes the wrong card, or
lies to you, or the deck falls.”</p>

<p>“I never perform a trick,” he said.
“I perform a process. There’s no outcome I need.”</p>

<p>I told that to Julia in bed that
night: “There’s no outcome he needs.”</p>

<p>“Sounds Eastern.”</p>

<p>“Definitely not Eastern European.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>I turned off the bedside light.</p>

<p>“That first trick. Or process. Max
really said your card?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t actually pick one.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to, but I just couldn’t
bring myself to.”</p>

<p>“So why did you cry?”</p>

<p>“Because Max still could.”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY NO ONE</p>

<p>The night I came back from Islip, I
went straight to the kids’ rooms. It was three in the morning. Benjy was
contorted into one of those almost inconceivably bizarre sleeping-child
positions: his tush way up in the air, his legs rigid, the weight of his body
driving his cheek into the pillow. He had sweated through his sheets and was
snoring like a tiny human animal. I reached out my hand, but before I’d even
touched him, his eyes sprang open: “I wasn’t asleep.”</p>

<p>“It’s OK,” I said, brushing his
damp hair with my hand. “Close your eyes.”</p>

<p>“I was awake.”</p>

<p>“You were doing sleep-breathing.”</p>

<p>“You’re home.”</p>

<p>“I am. I didn’t go.”</p>

<p>He smiled. His eyes closed too
slowly for it to be voluntary, and he said, “Tell me.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what?”</p>

<p>He opened his eyes, saw that I was
still there, smiled once again, and said, “I don’t know. Just tell me.”</p>

<p>“I came home.”</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and asked, “Did
you win the war?”</p>

<p>“You’re asleep.”</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and said, “I’m
only thinking about how you were in a war.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t go.”</p>

<p>“Oh. That’s good.” He closed his
eyes and said, “I know what it is.”</p>

<p>“What what is?”</p>

<p>“The n-word.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“I googled it.”</p>

<p>“Ah. OK.”</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. And though he
didn’t smile this time, I could hear, in his full exhalation, that he was again
relieved by my permanence.</p>

<p>“I’ll never use it,” he said.
“Never.”</p>

<p>“Good night, love.”</p>

<p>“I’m not asleep.”</p>

<p>“You’re falling asleep.”</p>

<p>His eyes closed. I kissed him. He
smiled.</p>

<p>“Is it a g like gun?” he asked. “Or
like ginger?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“The n-word. I don’t know how you
say it.”</p>

<p>“But you’re never going to say it.”</p>

<p>“But I still want to know how.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You aren’t going to go away again,
are you?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, because I didn’t know
what to say—to my child, or to myself.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY LOVE</p>

<p>Love is not a positive emotion. It
is not a blessing, and it is not a curse. It is a blessing that is a curse, and
it is also not that. LOVE OF ONE’S CHILDREN is not LOVE OF CHILDREN, is not
LOVE OF ONE’S SPOUSE, is not LOVE OF ONE’S PARENTS, is not LOVE OF ONE’S
EXTENDED FAMILY, is not LOVE OF THE IDEA OF FAMILY. LOVE OF JUDAISM is not LOVE
OF JEWISHNESS, is not LOVE OF ISRAEL, is not LOVE OF GOD. LOVE OF WORK is not
LOVE OF SELF. Not even LOVE OF SELF is LOVE OF SELF. The place where LOVE OF
NATION, LOVE OF HOMELAND, and LOVE OF HOME meet is nowhere. LOVE OF DOGS is to
LOVE OF ONE’S CHILD’S SLEEPING BODY as LOVE OF DOGS is to LOVE OF ONE’S DOG.
LOVE OF THE PAST has as much in common with LOVE OF THE FUTURE as LOVE OF LOVE
has with LOVE OF SADNESS—which is to say, everything. But then, LOVE OF SAYING
EVERYTHING makes one untrustworthy.</p>

<p>Without love, you die. With love,
you also die. Not all deaths are equal.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY ANGER</p>

<p>“You are my enemy!”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY FEAR OF DEATH</p>

<p>“Unfair! Unfair! Unfair!”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY THE INTERSECTION OF LOVE, ANGER, AND FEAR OF DEATH</p>

<p>At my annual cleaning, the dentist
spent an unusual amount of time looking in my mouth—not at my teeth, but
deeper—his instruments of pain slowly tarnishing, untouched, on the tray. He
asked if I’d been having a hard time swallowing.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Just curious.”</p>

<p>“I suppose a bit.”</p>

<p>“For how long?”</p>

<p>“A couple of months?”</p>

<p>“Did you ever mention it to your
doctor?”</p>

<p>He referred me to an oncologist at
Johns Hopkins.</p>

<p>I was surprised by my instinct to
call Julia. We hardly ever spoke anymore: she had long since remarried; the
kids were masters of their own logistics, being adults; and as one gets older,
there is less and less news to share, until the final piece, which is delivered
by someone else. The dialogue in the show is virtually identical to what
actually transpired, with one significant exception: in life, I didn’t cry. I
screamed: “Unfair! Unfair! Unfair!”</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>It’s me.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>I recognize your voice.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>It’s been a long time.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>And your number comes up on my
phone.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>As Jacob?</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>As opposed to what?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Listen—</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Is everything OK?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I was at the dentist this morning—</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>But I didn’t make an appointment
for you.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I’ve become remarkably capable.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Necessity is the ex-wife of
capability.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>He saw a lump in my throat.</p>

<p>Julia starts crying. Each is
surprised by her reaction to nothing (yet), and it goes on for longer than
either would have imagined or thought bearable.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You’re dying?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>The dentist, Julia.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You’re telling me he saw a lump,
and you’re calling me.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Both a lump and a phone call can be
benign, you know.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>So now what?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I have an appointment with an
oncologist at Hopkins.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Tell me everything.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>You know everything I know.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Have you had any other symptoms?
Stiffness in your neck? Difficulty swallowing?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Did you go to med school since we
last spoke?</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>I’m googling while we talk.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Yes, I’ve had stiffness in my neck.
And yes, I’ve had difficulty swallowing. Now will you please give me your
undivided attention?</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Is Lauren being supportive?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>You’d have to ask the man she’s
presently dating.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>I’m sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>And you’re the first person I’ve
told.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Do the boys know?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I told you, you’re the first—</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I’m sorry to have laid this on you.
I know I haven’t been your responsibility for a long time.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You were never my responsibility.</p>

<p>(beat)</p>

<p>And you still are my
responsibility.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I won’t tell the kids anything
until there’s something real to tell them.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Good. That’s good.</p>

<p>(beat)</p>

<p>How are you holding up?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I’m fine. He’s just a dentist.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>It’s OK to be scared.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>If he were so smart, he’d be a
dermatologist.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Have you cried?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>On November 18, 1985, when Lawrence
Taylor ended Joe Theismann’s career.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Enough, Jacob.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>He’s just a dentist.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You know, I don’t think I’ve ever
seen you cry. Other than tears of happiness when the boys were born. Is that
possible?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>At my grandfather’s funeral.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>That’s true. You wailed.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I wept.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>But remembering it as the exception
proves—</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>All those repressed tears
metastasized.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Yes, that’s exactly what the
dentist thought the oncologist will think.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Throat cancer.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Who said anything about cancer?</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Throat malignancy.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Is it too soon to observe how
poetic that is?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Way too soon. I haven’t even been
diagnosed, much less gone through super-fun chemo and recovery only to learn
that they didn’t get it all.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You’ll finally have your baldness.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I already do.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>No, really. I went off Propecia. I
look like Mr. Clean. Ask Benjy.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You saw him recently?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>He came by on Christmas Eve with
Chinese food.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>That’s sweet. How did he look?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Enormous. And old.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>I didn’t even know you were on
Propecia. But I guess I wouldn’t know what pills you take anymore.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I’ve actually been on it for a long
time.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>How long?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Around when Max was born?</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Our Max?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I was embarrassed. I kept them with
my cummerbund.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>That makes me so sad.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Me, too.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Why don’t you just cry, Jacob?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Sure thing.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>I’m serious.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>This isn’t Days of Our Lives. This
is life.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You’re afraid that letting anything
out will leave you open to letting things in. I know you. But it’s just the two
of us. Just you and me on the phone.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>And God. And the NSA.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Is this the person you want to be?
Always just joking? Always concealing, distracting, hiding? Never fully
yourself?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>You know, I was hunting for sympathy
when I called.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>And you killed it without having to
fire a shot. This is what real sympathy is.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>(after a long beat)</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>No what?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>No, I’m not the person I want to
be.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Well, you’re in good company.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Before I called, I found myself
asking—literally asking aloud, over and over—“Who’s a gentle soul? Who’s a
gentle soul?”</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I guess I wanted proof.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Of the existence of gentleness?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Gentleness for me.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Jacob.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I mean it. You have Daniel. The
boys have their lives. I’m the kind of person whose neighbors will have to
notice the smell for anyone to realize he’s dead.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Remember that poem? “Proof of Your
existence? There is nothing but”?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>God … I do. We bought that book at
Shakespeare and Company. Read it on the bank of the Seine with a baguette and
cheese and no knife. That was so happy. So long ago.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Look around, Jacob. There is
nothing but proof of how loved you are. The boys idolize you. Your friends
flock to you. I bet women—</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>You? What about you?</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>I’m the gentle soul you called,
remember?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I’m sorry.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>For what?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>We’re in the Days of Awe right now.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>I know I know what that means, but
I can’t remember.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>The days between Rosh Hashanah and
Yom Kippur. The world is uniquely open. God’s ears are, His eyes, His heart.
People, too.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You’ve become some Jew.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I don’t believe any of it, but I
believe in it.</p>

<p>(beat)</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s during these ten days
that we’re supposed to ask our loved ones to forgive us for all of the wrongs
we committed—“knowingly and unknowingly.”</p>

<p>(beat)</p>

<p>Julia—</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>He’s just a dentist.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I am so sincerely sorry for any
times that I knowingly or unknowingly wronged you.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>You didn’t wrong me.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>We made mistakes, both of us.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>The Hebrew word for sin translates
to “missing the mark.” I am sorry for the times that I sinned against you by
small degrees, and I am sorry for the times that I sinned against you by
running directly away from what I should have been running toward.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>There was another line in that
book: “And everything that once was infinitely far and unsayable is now
unsayable and right here in the room.”</p>

<p>The silence is so complete, neither
is sure if the connection has been lost.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>You opened the door, unknowingly. I
closed it, unknowingly.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>What door?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Sam’s hand.</p>

<p>Julia starts to cry, quietly.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>I forgive you, Jacob. I do. For
everything. All that we hid from each other, and all that we allowed between
us. The pettiness. The holding in and holding on. The measuring. None of it
matters anymore.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>None of it ever mattered.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>It did. But not as much as we
thought it did.</p>

<p>(beat)</p>

<p>And I hope that you will forgive
me.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>(after a long beat)</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re right. It would be
good if I could let my sadness out.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>Your anger.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I’m not angry.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>But you are.</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>I’m really not.</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>What are you so angry about?</p>

<p>JACOB</p>

<p>Julia, I’m—</p>

<p>JULIA</p>

<p>What happened to you?</p>

<p>They are silent. But it’s a
different silence than the kind they’d known. Not the silence of just joking,
concealing, distracting. Not the silence of walls, but the silence of creating
a space to fill.</p>

<p>With each passing second—and the
seconds are passing, two by two—more space is created. It takes the shape of
the home they might have moved to had they decided to give it one more shot, to
go deeply and unconditionally into the work of re-finding their happiness
together. Jacob can feel the pull of the unoccupied space, the aching longing
to be allowed into what is wide open to him.</p>

<p>He cries.</p>

<p>When was the last time he cried?
When he put down Argus? When he awoke Max to tell him he hadn’t gone to Israel,
and Max said, “I knew you wouldn’t go”? When he tried to encourage Benjy’s
budding interest in astronomy, and took him all the way to Marfa, where they
got a tour of the observatory and held galaxies in their eyes like oceans in
shells, and when that night they lay on their backs on the roof of the Airbnb
cabin and Benjy asked, “Why are we whispering?” and Jacob said, “I hadn’t even
noticed that we were,” and Benjy said, “When people look at stars, they tend to
whisper. I wonder why”?</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY LATE MEMORIES</p>

<p>My earliest memory is of my father
handling a dead squirrel.</p>

<p>My last memory of the old house is
leaving the key in the mailbox in an envelope with a stamp and no destination
or return address.</p>

<p>My last memory of my mother is
spoon-feeding her yogurt. I reflexively made the airplane sound, though I
hadn’t done that for fifteen years. I was too embarrassed to acknowledge it
with an apology. She winked, I was sure.</p>

<p>My last memory of Argus is hearing
his breathing deepen, and feeling his pulse slow, and then watching myself
reflected in his eyes as they rolled back.</p>

<p>Despite the texts and e-mails that
we have continued to send back and forth, my last memory of Tamir is from
Islip. I told him, “Stay.” He asked, “Then who would go?” And I said, “No one.”
And he asked, “Then what would save it?” And I said, “Nothing.” “Just let it
go?” he asked.</p>

<p>My last memory of my family before
the earthquake is by the front door, my parents about to take Benjy for the night,
Sam and Julia about to leave for Model UN. Benjy asked, “What if I don’t miss
you?” Of course he didn’t know what was about to happen, but how could I
remember it any way other than as prophetic?</p>

<p>My last memory of my father is
dropping him and his girlfriend at Dulles for his bucket-list trip to the
Warsaw Ghetto—his Cooperstown—and my saying, “Who’d have thought it? Taking a
shiksa to the Reverse Diaspora Prom?” I always felt that he withheld his
laughter from me, but that got a good one. He patted my cheek and said, “Life
amazes.” Of course he didn’t know he wouldn’t make it onto the plane, but how
could I remember it any way other than as ironic?</p>

<p>My last memory of being married to
Julia: the burnished handle of the snack drawer; the seam where the slabs of
soapstone met; the Special Award for Bravery sticker on the underside of the
island’s overhang, given to Max for what no one knew was his last pulled tooth,
a sticker Argus saw many times every day, and only Argus ever saw. Julia said:
“It’s way too late in the conversation for that.”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY “WHAT IS YOUR NAME?”</p>

<p>Max asked to have a bar mitzvah.
Even if it was the expression of something subterranean, even if it was some
kind of hypersophisticated act of aggression, it still pleased Julia and me.
The year of study went off without a hitch or complaint, the service was
beautiful (Julia and I stood together at the ark, which felt good and right),
the party was themeless and genuinely fun, and he banked enough savings bonds
to buy something pretty great just as soon as they matured to their face value
in twenty years, at which point twice as much would seem like half as much.</p>

<p>Max’s portion was Vayishlach, in
which Jacob—the last of the patriarchs—is assaulted by an unknown assailant in
the middle of the night. Jacob wrestles him down and refuses to let go,
demanding a blessing of him. The assailant—an angel, or God himself—asks, “What
is your name?” As Jacob holds on to the man with all his strength, he answers,
“Jacob.” (Jacob means “heel-grabber”—he grabbed the heel of his older brother,
Esau, as he was being born, wanting to be the first out.) Then the angel says,
“Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel—which means ‘wrestles God.’”</p>

<p>From the bimah, with a poise far
beyond his years or mine, Max said, “Jacob wrestled with God for the blessing.
He wrestled with Esau for the blessing. He wrestled with Isaac for the
blessing, with Laban for the blessing, and in each case he eventually
prevailed. He wrestled because he recognized that the blessings were worth the
struggle. He knew that you only get to keep what you refuse to let go of.</p>

<p>“Israel, the historical Jewish
homeland, literally means ‘wrestles God.’ Not ‘praises God,’ or ‘reveres God,’
or ‘loves God,’ not even ‘obeys God.’ In fact, it is the opposite of ‘obeys
God.’ Wrestling is not only our condition, it is our identity, our name.”</p>

<p>That last sentence sounded a lot
like Julia.</p>

<p>“But what is wrestling?”</p>

<p>That sounded like Dr. Silvers.</p>

<p>“There is Greco-Roman wrestling,
WWF wrestling, arm wrestling, sumo wrestling, lucha libre wrestling, wrestling
with ideas, wrestling with faith … They all have one thing in common:
closeness.”</p>

<p>And there I was, the intended
recipient of his speech, sitting so close to my ex-wife that the fabric of our
clothing touched, on a pew with children half of whose lives I was missing.</p>

<p>“You only get to keep what you
refuse to let go of,” Max said.</p>

<p>“A Jewish fist can do more than
masturbate and hold a pen,” my dad once said.</p>

<p>“To see your lifeline you have to
let go,” I pulled from a fortune cookie one Christmas.</p>

<p>Max kept getting smarter and
smarter. Julia and I had always assumed that Sam was the brains of the
bunch—that Max was the artist and Benjy would be perpetually adorable—but it
was Max who took chess seriously (he placed third in the D.C.-area
sixteen-and-unders), Max who elected to have a Mandarin tutor twice a week
(while his brain was still “supple”), and Max who was accepted to Harvard after
his junior year of high school. (Not until he chose to apply a year early did I
realize that all that extra credit—those supplemental courses, that summer
school—was a way to be away more, and get away sooner.)</p>

<p>“Closeness,” he said, surveying the
congregation. “It’s easy to be close, but almost impossible to stay close.
Think about friends. Think about hobbies. Even ideas. They’re close to
us—sometimes so close we think they are part of us—and then, at some point,
they aren’t close anymore. They go away. Only one thing can keep something
close over time: holding it there. Grappling with it. Wrestling it to the
ground, as Jacob did with the angel, and refusing to let go. What we don’t
wrestle we let go of. Love isn’t the absence of struggle. Love is struggle.”</p>

<p>That sounded like the person I
wanted to be, but couldn’t be. It sounded like Max.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY NO ONE</p>

<p>I heard the shutter before I saw
the photographer. It was the first and only shot of my war.</p>

<p>“Hey,” I said, stomping toward him.
“What the hell are you doing?”</p>

<p>Why the hell was I so upset?</p>

<p>“I’m here for the Times,” he said,
showing me the press pass hanging from his neck.</p>

<p>“You’re supposed to be here?”</p>

<p>“The consulate gave me
authorization, if that’s what you’re asking.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t give you
authorization to take a picture of me.”</p>

<p>“You want me to delete the photo?”
he asked, neither assertive nor conciliatory.</p>

<p>“It’s fine,” I said, “but don’t
take any more.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want a problem. I’m happy
to delete it.”</p>

<p>“Keep it,” I said. “But no more.”</p>

<p>He walked off to take pictures of
other groups. Some of them posed. Some were either unaware of his presence or
unwilling to recognize it. My knee-jerk anger—if that’s even what it
was—surprised me. But harder to explain was my insistence that he keep the
photo he’d taken but not take any more. What two ways was I trying to have it?</p>

<p>My mind wandered to all those years
of school portraits: the licked palms wrestling cowlicks under the pretense of
a loving stroke; letting the boys watch a cartoon while sliding them into
handsome, uncomfortable clothes; clumsy efforts to subliminally communicate the
value of a “natural” smile. The pictures always came out the same: a forced
grin with unparted lips, eyes vacantly gazing into the haze—something from the
Diane Arbus scrap pile. But I loved them. I loved the truth they conveyed: that
kids aren’t yet able to fake it. Or they aren’t yet able to conceal their
disingenuousness. They’re wonderful smilers, the best; but they’re the very
worst fake smilers. The inability to fake a smile defines childhood. When Sam
thanked me for his room in my new house, he became a man.</p>

<p>One year Benjy was genuinely
disturbed by his school portrait, unwilling to believe that the child in the
picture was either him or not him. Max took it upon himself to prod Benjy’s
distress, explaining to him that everyone has a living self and a dead self
existing in parallel—“kind of like your own ghost”—and that the only time we
ever get to see our dead selves is in school portraits. Soon enough, Benjy was
crying. In an effort to calm him, I took out my bar mitzvah album. We’d already
looked through several dozen photos when Benjy said, “But I thought Sam’s bar
mitzvah was in the future.”</p>

<p>At my bar mitzvah party, relatives,
friends of my parents, and complete strangers handed me envelopes with savings
bonds. When my suit’s jacket pockets started to strain, I’d give the envelopes
to my mother, who put them in the purse under her chair. My father and I
tabulated the “righteous plunder” at the kitchen table that night. I can’t
remember the figure, but I remember that it was evenly divisible by eighteen.</p>

<p>I remember the albumin archipelago
on the salmon. I remember how the singer smudged ve-nismecha in “Hava Nagila,”
like a kid singing the alphabet, believing that l-m-n-o is one letter. I
remember being lifted in the chair, high above the Jewish masses, the
coronation of the One-Eyed Man. Back on the parquet, my father told me to go
spend a few minutes with my grandfather. I venerated him, as I was taught to,
but it was never not a chore.</p>

<p>“Hi, Grandpa,” I said, offering the
top of my head for his kiss.</p>

<p>“I put some money into your college
account,” he said, patting the empty chair beside him.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Did Dad tell you how much?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He looked to both sides, beckoned
my ear to his lips, and whispered, “One thousand four hundred forty dollars.”</p>

<p>“Wow,” I said, reestablishing a
comfortable distance. I had no idea if that many dollars justified that
presentation, but I knew what was expected of me: “That’s so incredibly
generous. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“But also this,” he said, straining
to get a grocery bag from the ground. He placed it on the table and removed
something wrapped in a napkin. I assumed it was a roll—he often stashed rolls
in napkins in bags—but then I felt its weight. “Go on,” he said. Inside was a
camera, a Leica.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I said, thinking the
gift was a camera.</p>

<p>“Benny and I went back after the
war, in 1946. We thought maybe our family had found a way to survive. At least
someone. But there was no one. A neighbor, one of my father’s friends, saw us
and brought us to his house. He had kept some of our things, in case we ever
came back. He told us that even though the war was over, it wasn’t safe, and
that we had to go. So we went. I only took a few things, and this was one of
them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“I sewed money and photographs into
the lining of the jacket I wore on the boat. I was so worried that someone
would try to steal my things. I promised myself I wouldn’t take it off, but it
was so hot, too hot. I slept with it in my arms, and one morning when I woke up,
my suitcase was still at my side, but the jacket was gone. That’s why I don’t
blame the person who took it. If he’d been a thief, he would have taken the
suitcase. He was just cold.”</p>

<p>“But you said it was hot.”</p>

<p>“It was hot for me.” He rested his
finger on the shutter release as if it were the trigger of a land mine. “I have
only one picture from Europe. It’s of me. It was marking my place in my diary
in my suitcase. The pictures of my brothers and parents were sewn into that
jacket. Gone. But this is the camera that took them.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your diary?”</p>

<p>“I let it go.”</p>

<p>What would I have seen in those
lost pictures? What would I have seen in the diary? Benjy didn’t recognize
himself in his school portrait, but what did I see when I looked at it? And
what did I see when I looked at the sonogram of Sam? An idea? A human? My
human? Myself? An idea of myself? I had to believe in him, and I did. I never
stopped believing in him, only in myself.</p>

<p>In his bar mitzvah speech, Sam said,
“We didn’t ask for a nuclear weapon, and didn’t want a nuclear weapon, and
nuclear weapons are, in pretty much every way, horrible. But there’s a reason
people have them, and it’s to never have to use them.”</p>

<p>Billie shouted something I didn’t
understand, but I understood the flicker of happiness in Sam’s eyes. The
tension in the room flowed to the corners; Sam’s speech divided and redivided
into small talk. I brought him some food and told him, “You’re so much better
than I was at your age. Or am now.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a competition,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, it’s progress. Come with me
for a second.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, where? Mount
Moriah, of course.”</p>

<p>I led him upstairs, to my dresser,
and took the Leica from the bottom drawer.</p>

<p>“This was your great-grandpa’s. He
brought it over from Europe. He gave it to me on my bar mitzvah and told me
that he had no pictures of his brothers or parents, but that this camera had
taken pictures of them. I know he wanted you to have it.”</p>

<p>“He told you that?”</p>

<p>“No. But I know that—”</p>

<p>“So you’re the one who wants me to
have it.”</p>

<p>Who was leading whom?</p>

<p>“I do,” I said.</p>

<p>He held it in his hands, turned it
around a few times. “Does it work?”</p>

<p>“Gosh, I don’t know. I’m not sure
that’s the point.”</p>

<p>He said, “Shouldn’t it be?”</p>

<p>Sam had the Leica refurbished; he
brought it into the world and it brought him out of Other Life.</p>

<p>He studied philosophy in college,
but only in college.</p>

<p>He left the Leica on a train in
Peru on his honeymoon with his first wife.</p>

<p>At thirty-eight, he became the
youngest judge ever appointed to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit.</p>

<p>The boys took me to Great Wall
Szechuan House for my sixty-fifth birthday. Sam raised his bottle of Tsingtao
and gave a beautiful toast, ending with “Dad, you’re always looking.” I didn’t
know whether he meant searching or seeing.</p>

<p>Tamir was sitting on the terminal’s
floor, his back against the wall, his eyes on the phone in his hands. I went
and sat beside him.</p>

<p>“I’m having second thoughts,” I
said.</p>

<p>He smiled, nodded.</p>

<p>“Tamir?”</p>

<p>He nodded again.</p>

<p>“Can you stop texting for a second
and listen?”</p>

<p>“I’m not texting,” he said, and
turned his phone to face me: a grid of thumbnails of family photos.</p>

<p>“I’m having second thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Only second?”</p>

<p>“Could you talk this through with
me?”</p>

<p>“What is there to talk through?”</p>

<p>“You’re returning to your family,”
I said. “I would be leaving mine.”</p>

<p>“Would be?”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that. I’m asking for your
help.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are. I think
you’re asking for forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“For what? I haven’t even done
anything.”</p>

<p>“Every thought after the first
thought will lead you back to Newark Street.”</p>

<p>“That’s not necessarily true.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily?”</p>

<p>“I’m here. I said goodbye to my
children.”</p>

<p>“You don’t owe me an apology,” he
said. “It’s not your country.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ve been wrong about that.”</p>

<p>“Apparently you were right.”</p>

<p>“And like you said, even if it
isn’t my home, it’s yours.”</p>

<p>“Who are you, Jacob?”</p>

<p>For three consecutive years, Max’s
eyes were closed in his school portrait. The first time, it was a small
disappointment, but mostly funny. The second year, it was harder to excuse as
an accident. We talked about why such photos are nice to have, how much his
grandparents and great-grandfather cherished them, how it was a waste of money
to spoil them on purpose. The morning of picture day that third year, we asked
Max to look us in the eye and promise to keep his eyes open. “I’ll try,” he
said, his eyes blinking wildly, as if to flush out a fly. “Don’t try,” Julia
said, “do it.” When the photos came back, all three boys had closed their eyes.
But I’ve never seen more genuine smiles.</p>

<p>“Maybe this is who I am,” I said to
Tamir.</p>

<p>“You say that as if you couldn’t
choose to be who you wanted to be.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I choose this.”</p>

<p>“Maybe?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I should do, and
I’m asking you to talk this through with me.”</p>

<p>“So let’s talk it through. Who are
you?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You said, ‘Maybe this is who I
am.’ So who, maybe, are you?”</p>

<p>“Come on, Tamir.”</p>

<p>“What? I’m asking you to explain
what you meant. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“It’s not the kind of thing that
can be articulated like that.”</p>

<p>“Try. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“OK, never mind. I’m sorry I came
over here.”</p>

<p>“Who are you, Jacob?”</p>

<p>“Who are you, Tamir?”</p>

<p>“I am someone who goes home, no
matter how difficult.”</p>

<p>“Well then, you took the words out
of my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. But not out of your heart.
Wherever you go, you won’t be going home.”</p>

<p>When my mother first got sick, she
mentioned that my father visited Isaac’s grave once a month. When I asked him
about it, he deflected, as if I’d confronted him about a gambling addiction.</p>

<p>“Penance for burying him in
America,” he said.</p>

<p>“What do you do there?”</p>

<p>“Just stand around like a jerk.”</p>

<p>“Can I go with you next time?” I
asked my father; I told Tamir, “Stay.”</p>

<p>“Then who would go?” Tamir asked.</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Then what would save it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Just let it go?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I was right: my father cleaned the
site of twigs, leaves, and weeds; he wiped down the gravestone with a wet rag
he’d brought in a ziplock in his jacket pocket; and from another ziplock he
removed photos.</p>

<p>“The boys,” he said, turning them
toward me for a moment and then laying them on the ground, facedown, above his
father’s eyes.</p>

<p>I’d wanted to make an eruv around
the suicides and carry the shame away from them, but how would I bear my own
shame? How, coming home from Islip, would I face Julia and the boys?</p>

<p>“It feels like we were burying him
five minutes ago,” I said to my father; I said to Tamir, “It feels like we were
picking you up at the airport five minutes ago.”</p>

<p>My father said, “It feels like
everything was five minutes ago.”</p>

<p>Tamir brought his lips to my ear
and whispered, “You are innocent.”</p>

<p>“What?” I whispered, as if I were
looking at stars.</p>

<p>“You are innocent.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>He pulled back and said, “No, like,
too trusting. Too childlike.”</p>

<p>“What, gullible?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that word.”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to say?”</p>

<p>“Of course Steven Spielberg wasn’t
in the men’s room.”</p>

<p>“You made up that whole thing?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“You knew who he was?”</p>

<p>“You think we don’t have
electricity in Israel?”</p>

<p>“You’re very good,” I said.</p>

<p>“I see you,” my grandfather would
say from the other side of the glass.</p>

<p>“You’re very innocent,” Tamir said.</p>

<p>“See you,” my grandfather would
say.</p>

<p>“And yet we’ve never been older,”
my father said, and then chanted the Mourner’s Kaddish.</p>

HOW TO PLAY SUICIDE</p>

<p>Unbuckle your belt. Slide it back
out the five loops of your pants. Wrap it around your throat and tighten,
buckle on the back of your neck. Place the other end of the belt over the door.
Close the door, so that the belt is held firmly in place between the top of the
door and the doorframe. Look at the refrigerator. Allow full body weight to
fall. Eight closed eyes.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY REINCARNATION</p>

<p>A few months after moving out, on
yet another day without a letter in the mailbox on my bedroom door, I was
emptying the kids’ hampers and found a poop in a pair of Max’s underwear. He
was eleven. I got several such dispatches in the coming weeks. Sometimes I was
able to turn the underwear inside out over the toilet, scrub at any stain that
was left, and throw them into the wash. Usually they weren’t salvageable.</p>

<p>I didn’t mention it to Dr. Silvers,
for the same reason I didn’t mention my persistent throat pain to my actual
doctor: I suspected it was a symptom of something that I didn’t want revealed.
I didn’t mention it to Julia, because I didn’t want to hear that Max never did
it at her house. And I didn’t mention it to Max, because that was something I
could spare him. Spare us.</p>

<p>As a child, I used to leave bowel
movements on the lilac carpet of my grandfather’s bathroom, a few inches from
the toilet seat. It was on purpose. Why did I do such a thing? Why did Max?</p>

<p>I desperately wanted a dog, as a
boy, but was told they were dirty. As a boy, I was told to wash my hands before
going to the bathroom, because the world was dirty. But I was also told to wash
my hands after.</p>

<p>My grandfather mentioned the poops
on his floor only once. He smiled, covered the side of my head with his
enormous hand, and said, “It’s OK. It’s great.” Why would he say such a thing?</p>

<p>Max never mentioned the poops in
his hamper, although he came upon me hanging a pair of his hand-washed
underwear on the drying rack and said, “Argus died the day we started coming to
this house. Do you think this ever would have felt like home to him?”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY MATTERS OF DEATH AND REBIRTH</p>

<p>Never speak about them.</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY BELIEF</p>

<p>At Julia’s second sonogram, we saw
Sam’s arms and legs. (Although he wasn’t “Sam” yet, but “the peanut.”) So began
the exodus from idea to thing. What you think about all the time, but
can’t—without aids—see, hear, smell, taste, or touch has to be believed in.
Only a few weeks later, when Julia was able to feel the peanut’s presence and
movements, it no longer only needed to be believed in, because it could also be
known. As the months progressed—it turned, kicked, hiccupped—we knew more and
more and had to believe less. And then Sam came, and belief fell away—it wasn’t
necessary anymore.</p>

<p>But it didn’t fall away completely.
There was some residue. And the inexplicable, unreasonable, illogical emotions
and behavior of parents can be explained, or partially explained, by having had
to believe for the better part of a year. Parents don’t have the luxury of
being reasonable, not any more than a religious person does. What can make
religious people and parents so utterly insufferable is also what makes
religion and parenthood so utterly beautiful: the all-or-nothing wager. The
faith.</p>

<p>I watched Sam being born through
the viewfinder of a video camera. When the doctor handed him to me, I put the
camera on the bed and forgot about it until the nurse came to take him for
measuring, or warming, or whatever utterly necessary thing they do with
newborns that justifies the teaching of that most important life lesson:
everyone, even your parents, will let you go.</p>

<p>But we had twenty minutes with him,
so we have a twenty-minute video of the view of the dark window, with the
soundtrack of new life—Sam’s new life, ours. I told Sam how beautiful he was. I
told Julia how beautiful Sam was. I told her how beautiful she was. All of it
was understatement, all of it imprecise—I used that same inadequate word to try
to convey three entirely different, essential meanings: beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful.</p>

<p>You can hear crying—everyone’s.</p>

<p>You can hear laughter—Julia’s and
mine.</p>

<p>You can hear Julia calling me “Dad”
for the first time. You can hear me whispering blessings to Sam, prayers: be
healthy, be happy, know peace. I said it over and over—be healthy, be happy,
know peace. It wasn’t the kind of thing I would say, and I hadn’t intended to
say it; the words were drawn from some well far deeper than my life, and the
hands raising the bucket weren’t my own. The last thing you can hear on the
video, as the nurse taps on the door, is me saying to Julia, “Before we know
it, he’ll be burying us.”</p>

<p>“Jacob…”</p>

<p>“OK, so we’ll be at his wedding.”</p>

<p>“Jacob!”</p>

<p>“His bar mitzvah?”</p>

<p>“Can’t we ease into it?”</p>

<p>“Into what?”</p>

<p>“The giving away.”</p>

<p>I was wrong about almost
everything. But I was right about the speed of the losing. Some of the moments
were interminably long—the first cruel night of sleep training; cruelly (it
felt) peeling him off a leg on the first day of school; pinning him down while
the doctor who wasn’t stitching his hand back together told me, “This is not a
time to be his friend”—but the years passed so quickly I had to search videos
and photo albums for proof of our shared life. It happened. It must have. We
did all that living. And yet it required evidence, or belief.</p>

<p>I told Julia, the night after Sam’s
injury, that it was too much love for happiness. I loved my boy beyond my
capacity to love, but I didn’t love the love. Because it was overwhelming.
Because it was necessarily cruel. Because it couldn’t fit into my body, and so
deformed itself into a kind of agonizing hypervigilance that complicated what
should have been the most uncomplicated of things—nurturing and play. Because
it was too much love for happiness. I was right about that, too.</p>

<p>Carrying Sam into the house for the
first time, I implored myself to remember every feeling and detail. One day I
would need to recall what the garden looked like when my first child first saw
it. I would need to know the sound of the car seat’s latch disengaging. My life
would depend on my ability to revisit my life—there would come a day when I
would trade a year of what remained to hold my babies for an hour. I was right
about that, too, without even knowing that Julia and I would one day divorce.</p>

<p>I did remember. I remembered all of
it: the drop of dried blood on the gauze around the circumcision wound; the
smell of the back of his neck; how to collapse an umbrella stroller with one
hand; holding his ankles above his head with one hand while wiping the insides
of his thighs; the viscosity of A&amp;D ointment; the eeriness of frozen breast
milk; the static of a baby monitor set to the wrong channel; the economy of
diaper bags; the transparency of new eyelids; how Sam’s hands lurched upward,
like those of his falling-monkey ancestors, whenever he was placed on his back;
the torturing irregularity of his breathing; my own inability to forgive myself
for the moments I looked away and something utterly inconsequential happened,
but happened. It happened. All of it. And yet it made a believer out of me.</p>

HOW TO PLAY PRAYER</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY NO ONE</p>

<p>The night I came home from Islip
was the last night I spent in bed with Julia. She shifted when I got under the
covers. She mumbled, “That was a short war.”</p>

<p>I said, “I just kissed the kids.”</p>

<p>She asked, “Did we win?”</p>

<p>I said, “As it turns out, there is
no we.”</p>

<p>She asked, “Did I win?”</p>

<p>“Win?”</p>

<p>She turned onto her side and said,
“Survive.”</p>

<p>
HOW TO PLAY “HERE I AM”</p>

<p>A clause near the end of our legal
divorce agreement stated that should either of us have more children, the
children we had together would be treated “no less favorably” financially,
either in life or in our wills. Despite all the longer thorns, and there were
many, this one dug into Julia. But rather than acknowledge what at the time I
assumed was the source of her distress—that because of our ages, having more
children was realistic only for me—she attached herself to the issue that
wasn’t even there.</p>

<p>“I would never, in a million years,
remarry,” she told the mediator.</p>

<p>“This doesn’t concern remarriage,
but rather having children.”</p>

<p>“If I were to have more children,
which I will not, it would be in the context of a marriage, which is not going
to happen.”</p>

<p>“Life is long,” he said.</p>

<p>“And the universe is even bigger,
but we don’t seem to be getting a lot of visits from intelligent life.”</p>

<p>“That’s only because we’re not in
the Jewish Home yet,” I said, trying at once to calm her and to create a bit of
innocent camaraderie with the mediator, who shot me a confused look.</p>

<p>“And it’s not long,” Julia said.
“If life were long, I wouldn’t be halfway through it.”</p>

<p>“We aren’t halfway through it,” I
said.</p>

<p>“You aren’t, because you’re a man.”</p>

<p>“Women live longer than men.”</p>

<p>“Only technically.”</p>

<p>As ever, the mediator wouldn’t take
the bait. He cleared his throat, as if swinging a machete to clear a path through
our overgrown history, and said, “This clause, which I should say is entirely
standard for agreements like yours, won’t affect you in the event that you
don’t have any more children. It merely protects you and your children if Jacob
does.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it in there,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Can we move on to something
genuinely contentious?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “I don’t want it in
there.”</p>

<p>“Even if that means forfeiting your
legal protection?” the mediator asked.</p>

<p>“I trust Jacob not to treat other
children more favorably than ours.”</p>

<p>“Life is long,” I said, winking at
the mediator without moving an eyelid.</p>

<p>“Is that some kind of joke?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Obviously.”</p>

<p>The mediator cleared his throat
again and drew a line through the clause.</p>

<p>Julia wouldn’t let it go, not even
after we’d removed what wasn’t there to begin with. In the middle of a
discussion of something entirely unrelated—how to handle Thanksgiving,
Halloween, and birthdays; whether it was necessary to legally forbid the
presence of a Christmas tree in either’s home—she might say, “Divorce gets an
unfair rap; it was marriage that did this.” Such out-of-context statements
became part of the routine—at once impossible to anticipate and unsurprising.
The mediator showed an almost autistic patience for her Tourettic eruptions,
until one afternoon, when splitting the hairs of medical decision-making in the
event that one parent couldn’t be reached, she said, “I will literally die
before I remarry,” and, without clearing his throat or missing a beat, he
asked, “Do you want me to put in some language legally codifying that?”</p>

<p>She started dating Daniel about
three years after the divorce. To my knowledge, which was greatly limited by
the kindness of kids who were trying to protect me, she didn’t date very much
before him. She seemed to relish the quiet and aloneness, just as she’d always
said, and I’d never believed, she would. Her architecture practice flowered:
two of her houses were built (one in Bethesda, one on the shore), and she got a
commission to convert a grand Dupont Circle mansion into a museum showcasing
the contemporary art collection of a local supermarket oligarch. Benjy—who was
no less kind than his brothers, but far less psychologically
sophisticated—would increasingly mention Daniel, usually in the context of his
ability to edit movies on his laptop. That humble skill, which could be learned
in an afternoon by someone willing to devote an afternoon to learning it,
dramatically changed Benjy’s life. All the “babyish” movies he had been making
on the waterproof digital camera I got him two Hanukkahs before were suddenly
brought to life as fully realized “adult films.” (I never suggested that the
camera should stay at my house, and we never corrected his terminology.) Once,
when I was dropping the boys back at Julia’s after a particularly fun weekend
of adventures I’d spent the previous two weeks planning, Benjy grabbed at my
leg and said, “You have to go?” I told him I did, but that he was going to have
a great time and we’d see each other again in just a couple of days. He turned
to Julia and asked, “Is Daniel here?” “He’s at a meeting,” she said, “but he’ll
be back any minute.” “Aw, another meeting? I wanna make an adult film.” When my
car rounded the corner, I saw a man, about my age, in clothing I might wear,
sitting on a bench, no reading material, no purpose but to wait.</p>

<p>I knew he went on the safari with
them.</p>

<p>I knew he took Max to Wizards
games.</p>

<p>At some point he moved in. I don’t
know when; it was never presented to me as news.</p>

<p>“What does Daniel do?” I asked the
boys one night over Indian. We ate out a lot in those days, because it was hard
for me to find the necessary time to grocery shop and cook, but more because I
was obsessed with proving to them that we could still have “fun.” And eating
out is fun. Until someone asks, “Where are we having dinner tonight?” At which
point it begins to feel depressing.</p>

<p>“He’s a scientist,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“But not a Nobel Prize winner or
anything,” Max said. “Just a scientist.”</p>

<p>“What kind of scientist?”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” Sam and Max said at the
same time, but no one said “Jinx.”</p>

<p>“He’s an astrophysicist,” Benjy
said. And then: “Are you sad?”</p>

<p>“That he’s an astrophysicist?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>Julia asked a few times if I would
go out for a drink with him, get to know him. She said it would mean a lot to
her, and to Daniel, and that it could only be good for the boys. I told her,
“Of course.” I told her, “That sounds great.” And I believed myself as I said
it. But it never happened.</p>

<p>As we were saying goodbye after one
of Max’s teacher conferences, she told me that she and Daniel were going to get
married.</p>

<p>“Does this mean you’re dead?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“You would sooner die than
remarry.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “No, not dead.
Reincarnated.”</p>

<p>“As yourself?”</p>

<p>“As myself plus time.”</p>

<p>“Myself plus time is my father.”</p>

<p>She laughed again. Was her laugh
spontaneous or generous? “The nice thing about reincarnation is that life
becomes a process rather than an event.”</p>

<p>“Wait, you’re serious?”</p>

<p>“Just stuff from yoga.”</p>

<p>“Well, it flies in the face of
stuff from science.”</p>

<p>“As I was saying. Life becomes a
process rather than an event. Like that thing the magician told you, about
tricks and outcomes. You don’t need to achieve enlightenment, only move
yourself closer to it. Only become a bit more accepting.”</p>

<p>“Most things shouldn’t be
accepted.”</p>

<p>“Accepting of the world—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I live in the world.”</p>

<p>“Of yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s more complicated.”</p>

<p>“One life is too much pressure.”</p>

<p>“So is the Marianas Trench, but
such is reality. And by the way, what was all that shit about Max being too
conscientious?”</p>

<p>“Staying in at recess to go over
his homework?”</p>

<p>“He’s diligent.”</p>

<p>“He wants to control what is
possible to control.”</p>

<p>“Stuff from yoga?”</p>

<p>“I actually got myself a Dr.
Silvers.”</p>

<p>Why did that trigger my jealousy?
Because my feelings about her marriage were too extreme to be felt directly?</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I believe in a lot
of things. But at the very top of the list of things I don’t believe in is
reincarnation.”</p>

<p>“You’re constantly coming back,
Jacob. Just always as yourself.”</p>

<p>I didn’t ask if the kids knew
before me, and if so, for how long. She didn’t tell me when it was going to
happen, or if I was going to be invited.</p>

<p>I asked, “Does this mean I’m going
to be treated less favorably?” She laughed. I hugged her, told her how happy I
was for her, and went home and ordered a video game system, as we’d always
agreed we wouldn’t.</p>

<p>The wedding was three months later,
and I was invited, and the kids did know before me, but only by a day. I told
them not to mention the video game system to her, and that was the actual
missing of the mark.</p>

<p>I can’t help but compare it to our
wedding. There were fewer people, but many of the same people. What did they
think when they saw me? Those who had the guts to approach either pretended
there was nothing remotely awkward going on, that we were simply making small
talk at the wedding of a mutual friend, or they put their hands on my shoulder.</p>

<p>Julia and I were always good at
catching eyes, even after the divorce. We just had a way of finding each other.
It was a joke between us. “How will I find you in the theater?” “By being you.”
But it didn’t happen once all afternoon. She was preoccupied, but she must also
have been keeping track of where I was. I thought about slipping out at various
points, but that was not to be done.</p>

<p>The boys gave a charming speech
together.</p>

<p>I asked for red.</p>

<p>Daniel spoke thoughtfully, and
lovingly. He thanked me for being there, for welcoming him. I nodded, I smiled.
He moved on.</p>

<p>I asked for red.</p>

<p>I remembered my mother’s speech at
my wedding: “In sickness and in sickness. That is what I wish for you. Don’t
seek or expect miracles. There are no miracles. Not anymore. And there are no
cures for the hurt that hurts most. There is only the medicine of believing
each other’s pain, and being present for it.” Who will believe my pain? Who
will be present for it?</p>

<p>I watched the horah from my table,
watched the boys lift their mother in the chair. She was laughing so hard, and
I was sure that with her up at that vantage we would catch eyes, but we didn’t.</p>

<p>A salad was placed in front of me.</p>

<p>Julia and Daniel went from table to
table to make sure they said hello to every guest, and for pictures. I saw it
approaching, like the wave at a Nats game, and there was nothing to do but
participate.</p>

<p>I stood at the margin. The
photographer said, “Say mocha,” which I did not. He took it three times to be
sure. Julia whispered to Daniel, gave him a kiss. He walked off, and she took
the seat beside me.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you came.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Not of course. It was a choice you
made, and I know it’s not uncomplicated.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you wanted me here.”</p>

<p>“Are you OK?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Very much so.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>I looked around the room: the
doomed flowers, sweating water glasses, lipstick in purses left on chairs,
guitars becoming detuned against speakers, knives that had attended thousands
of unions.</p>

<p>“You want to hear something sad?” I
said. “I always thought I was the happy one. The happier one, I should say. I
never thought of myself as happy.”</p>

<p>“You want to hear something even
sadder? I thought I was the unhappy one.”</p>

<p>“I guess we were both wrong.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “we were both
right. But only in the context of our marriage.”</p>

<p>I put my hands on my knees, as if
to further ground myself.</p>

<p>“Were you there when my dad said
that thing? ‘Without context, we’d all be monsters’?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. Or I don’t
remember it.”</p>

<p>“Our context made monsters of us.”</p>

<p>“No, not monsters,” she said. “We
were good, and we raised three amazing kids.”</p>

<p>“And now you’re happy, and I’m
still me.”</p>

<p>“Life is long,” she said, trusting
me to remember.</p>

<p>“The universe is bigger,” I said,
proving myself.</p>

<p>Sea bass was placed in front of me.</p>

<p>I picked up my fork, so as to touch
something, and said, “Can I ask you a question?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“What do you tell people when they
ask why we got divorced?”</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time since anyone
has.”</p>

<p>“What did you used to tell them?”</p>

<p>“That we realized we were just
really good friends, good co-parents.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t those reasons not to get
divorced?”</p>

<p>She smiled and said, “I had a hard
time explaining it.”</p>

<p>“Me, too. I always sounded like I
was hiding something. Or guilty about something. Or just fickle.”</p>

<p>“It’s not really anyone else’s
business.”</p>

<p>“What do you tell yourself?”</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time since I
asked myself.”</p>

<p>“What did you used to tell
yourself?”</p>

<p>She picked up my spoon and said,
“We got divorced because that’s what we did. It’s not a tautology.”</p>

<p>While the waiters were bringing
dinner to the final tables, the first tables were being brought dessert.</p>

<p>“And the boys?” I asked. “How did
you explain it to them?”</p>

<p>“They never really asked me.
Sometimes they’d trace the outline, but they’d never enter. With you?”</p>

<p>“Never once. Isn’t that odd?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, a bride in her
dress. “It’s not.”</p>

<p>I looked at my boys being silly
children on the dance floor and said, “Why did we put them in the position of
having to ask?”</p>

<p>“Our love for them got in the way
of being good parents.”</p>

<p>I ran my finger around the rim of
my glass, but no music came.</p>

<p>“I’d be a much better father if I
could do it again.”</p>

<p>“You can,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to have any more
kids.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t have a time machine.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t believe in
reincarnation.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“Think we could have made it?” I
asked. “If we’d tried harder? Gone back into things?”</p>

<p>“Made what?”</p>

<p>“Life.”</p>

<p>“We made three lives,” she said.</p>

<p>“Could we have made one?”</p>

<p>“Is that the question?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Making it. Not failing. There are
more ambitious things to do with life.”</p>

<p>“Are there?”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>On the drive to the party, I’d
listened to a podcast about asteroids, and how unprepared we are for the
possibility of one heading toward us. The physicist being interviewed explained
why none of the possible contingencies would work: nuking it would just turn a
cosmic cannonball into cosmic buckshot (and the debris would likely re-form in
a few hours due to gravity); robotic landers could deflect the asteroid with
mounted thrusters, if such things existed, which they don’t and won’t;
similarly implausible would be sending up an enormous spacecraft as a “gravity
tractor,” using its own mass to pull the asteroid away from Earth. “So what
would we do?” the host asked. “Probably nuke it,” the physicist said. “But you
said it would only break it into lots of asteroids that would hit us.” “That’s
right.” “So it wouldn’t work.” “Almost certainly not,” the physicist said, “but
it would be our best hope.”</p>

<p>Our best hope.</p>

<p>The expression didn’t awaken
anything in me at the time. It took Julia’s hope attaching itself to the other
terminal of my mind to jump-start my sadness.</p>

<p>“Remember when I smashed the
lightbulb? At our wedding?”</p>

<p>“Are you really asking me that?”</p>

<p>“Did you like that moment?”</p>

<p>“That’s a funny question,” she
said. “But yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Me, too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t even know what it’s
supposed to symbolize.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you asked.”</p>

<p>“I knew you would be.”</p>

<p>“So, some people think it’s to
remind us of all the destruction that was necessary to bring us to the moment
of our greatest happiness. Some people think it’s a kind of prayer: let us be
happy until the shards of this lightbulb reassemble. Some people think it’s a
symbol of fragility. But the interpretation I’ve never heard is the most
straightforward one: this is what we’re like. We are broken individuals,
committing to what will be a broken union in a broken world.”</p>

<p>“It’s less inspiring your way.”</p>

<p>It’s not, I thought. It’s more
inspiring.</p>

<p>I said, “There is nothing more
whole than a broken heart.”</p>

<p>“Silvers?”</p>

<p>“In fact, the Kotzker Rebbe.”</p>

<p>“Listen to you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been studying with the rabbi
who did my grandfather’s funeral.”</p>

<p>“Curiosity converted the cat.”</p>

<p>“Meowzel tov.”</p>

<p>How I loved her laugh.</p>

<p>I looked at Julia, and in that
moment I knew we never could have made it. But I also knew that she had been my
best hope.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange?” I said. “We had
sixteen years together. They felt like everything when we were in them, but as
time passes they will account for less and less of our lives. All of that
everything was just a … what? A chapter?”</p>

<p>“That’s not how I think about it.”</p>

<p>She tucked her hair behind her ear,
as I’d seen her do tens of thousands of times.</p>

<p>I asked, “Why are you crying?”</p>

<p>“Why am I crying? Why aren’t you
crying? This is life. I’m crying because this is my life.”</p>

<p>Just as the sound of the scooper
going into Argus’s dog food used to bring him running from wherever in the
house he was, the boys seemed almost telepathically drawn to their mother’s
tears.</p>

<p>“Why’s everyone crying?” Sam asked.
“Did someone win a gold medal?”</p>

<p>“Are you sad?” Benjy asked me.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to worry about me,”
I told him.</p>

<p>“It’s OK,” Julia said. “Let it be
OK.”</p>

<p>There was nothing more painful than
being the center of attention at my wife’s wedding, save for continuing to
think of her as my wife.</p>

<p>“Overjoyed?” Max asked, handing
Benjy the maraschino cherry from his Shirley Temple.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Flabbergasted? Cattywampussed?
Diaphanous?”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“So, what?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>What? What was the feeling? My
feeling?</p>

<p>“Remember when we talked about
absolute value? For physics, maybe?”</p>

<p>“Math.”</p>

<p>“And do you remember what it is?”</p>

<p>“Distance from zero.”</p>

<p>“I have no idea what you’re talking
about,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>Julia pulled him onto her lap and
said, “Neither do I.”</p>

<p>I said, “Sometimes feelings are
like that—not positive, not negative, just a lot.”</p>

<p>No one had any idea what I was
talking about. I didn’t know what I was talking about. I wished I could get Dr.
Silvers on the phone, put him on speaker, and ask him to explain me to myself
and my family.</p>

<p>After the divorce, I had a series
of brief relationships. I was lucky to have met those women. They were smart,
strong, fun, and giving. My explanations of what went wrong always came down to
an inability to live fully honestly with them. Dr. Silvers pushed me to explore
what I meant by “full honesty,” but he never challenged my reasoning, never
suggested that I was self-sabotaging or creating definitions that were
impossible to meet. He respected me while feeling sorry for me. Or that’s what
I wanted him to feel.</p>

<p>“It would be very difficult to live
like that,” he told me. “Fully honestly.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“You would not only open yourself
to a great deal of hurt, you would have to inflict a great deal of hurt.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t believe that it would
make you happier.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, either.”</p>

<p>He swiveled his chair and looked
out the window, as he often did when thinking, as if wisdom could be found only
in the distance. He swiveled back and said, “But if you were able to live like
that…” And then he stopped. He removed his glasses. In my twenty years of
knowing him, it was the only time he’d ever removed his glasses. He held the
bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. “If you were able to live
like that, our work here would be finished.”</p>

<p>I was never able to live like that,
but our work finished a year later, when he had a fatal heart attack while
jogging. I got a call from one of the therapists who had an office in the same
suite. She invited me to come and talk about it, but I didn’t want to talk to
her. I wanted to talk to him. I felt betrayed. He should have delivered the
news of his death.</p>

<p>And I should have delivered the
news of my sadness to the kids. But just as his death precluded Dr. Silvers
from sharing his death with me, my sadness kept my sadness from them.</p>

<p>The band members had assumed their
positions, and forgoing any musical foreplay, went straight into “Dancing on
the Ceiling.” The sea bass that was once in front of me no longer was; it must
have been taken away. The glass of wine that was once in front of me no longer was;
I must have drunk it.</p>

<p>The boys ran to the dance floor.</p>

<p>“I’ll slip out,” I told Julia.</p>

<p>“Islip,” she said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Islip out.” And then: “I’m sorry.
I didn’t—”</p>

<p>When we visited Masada, my father
filled his pockets with rocks, and without knowing what he was doing, knowing
only my need for his approval, I filled mine. Shlomo told us to put them back.
It was the first time I’d ever heard him say no to one of us. He said that if
everyone took a rock, Masada would be dispersed across mantels and bookshelves and
coffee tables, and there would be no Masada. Even as a boy, I knew that was
ridiculous—if anything is permanent, mountains are.</p>

<p>Islip out.</p>

<p>I walked to my car beneath a sky
clotted with near-Earth objects.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the wedding guest book
are my children’s signatures. They developed their handwriting on their own.
But I gave them their names.</p>

<p>I parked out front with two wheels
on the curb. I might not even have closed the front door behind me.</p>

<p>Here I am, writing in my
half-buried office while my family is dancing.</p>

<p>How many synagogues did Sam end up
building? Did any survive? Even a wall?</p>

<p>My synagogue is made of words. All
the spaces allow it to shift when the ground moves. At the threshold of the
sanctuary is the mezuzah, a doorframe nailed to the doorframe: the growth rings
of my family. Inside the ark are the broken and the whole: Sam’s crushed hand,
beside the hand that reached for his “I-know”; Argus lying in his own shit,
beside the ever-panting tail-wagger who would pee as soon as Max entered the house;
Tamir from after the war, beside Noam from before the war; my grandfather’s
never-unbending knees, beside my kiss on his great-grandson’s nonexistent
boo-boo; my father’s reflection in a mirror draped with black cloth, beside my
sons falling asleep in the rearview mirror, beside the person who will never
stop writing these words, who spent his life breaking his fists against the
door of his synagogue, begging to be allowed in, beside the boy who dreamed of
people fleeing the enormous bomb shelter for the safety of the world, the boy
who would have realized that the heavy, heavy door opens outward, that I was
inside the Holiest of Holies all along.</p>

<h1>VIII. HOME</h1>

<p>In the long aftermath of the
destruction of Israel, Jacob moved into his new house. It was a nice, if
slightly less nice, version of his old house: slightly lower ceilings; slightly
less old and less wide planked floors; a kitchen with hardware that if it was
called bespoke was called that by Home Depot; a bathtub that probably leached
BPA, and was probably from Home Depot, but held water; melamine closets with
nearly level shelves that performed their function and were nice enough; a
faint, not-pleasant attic smell filling the atticless house; Home Depot
doorknobs; middle-aged, rotting sub-Marvin windows that served as visual
thresholds rather than as barriers against the elements or sound; walls wavy
with uncharming trapped moisture; ominous peeling at the corners; subtly
sadistic wall colors; unflush light switch plates; a faux-porcelain Home Depot
vanity with wood-grained melamine drawers, in a bathroom the color of
discharge, whose toilet paper roll was out of reach of anyone who wasn’t
imported from Africa to dunk without jumping; ominous separation everywhere:
between the molding components, between the crown molding and the ceiling, the
floor molding and the floor, separation of the sink from the wall, the mantel
of the nonfunctioning fireplace from the wall, the unflush electrical plates
from the wall, the doorframes from the wall, the more-plastic-than-plastic Home
Depot rosettes from the jaundiced ceiling, the floorboards from one another. It
didn’t really matter, but it didn’t go unnoticed. He had to admit that he was
more bourgeois than he’d have liked to admit, but he knew what was important.
Those things were separating, too.</p>

<p>There was time, there was suddenly
a life of it, and Jacob’s needs were taking the shape of his needs, rather than
his ability to fulfill them. He was declaring his independence, and all of
it—from the interminable wait for the hot-water Messiah to the unflush plate
through which not enough threads of the cable nipple were exposed—filled him
with hope. Or a version of hope. Jacob might have forced her hand, but it was
Julia who chose the separation. And while his return from Islip could be
understood as the claiming of an identity, it could at least as easily be
understood as the forfeiture of one. So maybe he didn’t write his declaration
of independence, but he was happy to sign it. It was a version of happiness.</p>

<p>Forty-two is young, he kept telling
himself, like an idiot. He could hear his own idiocy loud and clear, and yet he
couldn’t stop announcing it. He would remind himself of advances in medical
technology, of his own efforts to eat less unhealthily, of the gym to which he
had a membership (albeit ceremonial), and of that fact Sam had once shared:
with each passing year, life expectancy increases by a year. Everyone who
didn’t smoke would live to be one hundred. Practitioners of yoga would outlive
Moses.</p>

<p>In time, his house would resemble
his home—some rugs, better hardware, wall colors in keeping with the Geneva
Convention, paintings and photos and lithos, calming lamplight, art books
stacked on surfaces, throws not thrown but crisply folded and laid over sofas
and chairs, maybe a wood-burning stove in the corner. And in time, everything
that was possible would be actual. He’d get a girlfriend, or not. Buy an
unexpected car, or probably not. Finally do something with the television show
he’d been emptying his soul into for more than a decade. (The soul being the
only thing that requires dispersal to accumulate.) Now that he no longer needed
to protect his grandfather, he’d stop writing the bible and get back to the
show itself. He’d take it to one of those producers who used to be interested
in what he was doing, back when he was doing things that could be shared. A lot
of time had passed, but they’d still remember him.</p>

<p>There had been more than one reason
to keep the pages in a drawer—he wasn’t only protecting others. But once there
was nothing left to lose, even Julia would see that the show wasn’t an escape
from the challenges of family life, but a redemption of his family’s
destruction.</p>

<p>Israel wasn’t destroyed—at least
not in the literal sense. It remained a Jewish country, with a Jewish army, and
borders only negligibly different from before the earthquake. Infinite debate
corkscrewed the question of whether those new borders were good for the Jews.
Although, tellingly, the expression most often used by American Jews was good
for the Israelis. And that, the Israelis thought, was bad for the Jews.</p>

<p>Israel had been made weaker, but
its enemies were made weaker still. Not much comfort can be taken, when sifting
through your rubble with a bulldozer, in the knowledge that your enemy is
sifting through his rubble by hand. But some comfort can be taken. As Isaac
would have said, “It could be worse.” No, he would have said, “It is worse.”</p>

<p>Maybe he was right. Maybe it was
worse to have survived, if continuing to be required destroying the reason to
be. It’s not as if American Jews stopped caring. They continued to vacation and
bar mitzvah and find themselves in Israel. They winced as their small cuts were
first touched by Dead Sea water, winced as their hearts were first touched by
“Hatikvah,” crammed folded wishes between the rubble of the Wailing Wall,
recounted back-alley hummus spots, recounted the thrill of distant rocket
strikes, winced as their eyes were first touched by the sun at Masada,
recounted the perpetual thrill of seeing Jewish garbagemen, and Jewish
firefighters, and Jewish homeless. But the feeling of having arrived, of
finally finding a place of comfort, of being home, was disappearing.</p>

<p>For some, it was the inability to
forgive Israel’s actions during the war—even a massacre or two would have been
easier to accept than the complete and explicit abdication of responsibility
for non-Jews—the withdrawal of security forces and emergency personnel, the
stockpiling of medical supplies that had urgent use elsewhere, the withholding
of utilities, the rationing of food even amid a surplus, the blockade of aid
shipments to Gaza and the West Bank. Irv—whose once-daily, occasionally
inflammatory blog had become a rushing river of provocation—defended Israel at
every step: “If it were a family in a time of emergency, and not a country, no
one would judge parents for keeping food in the fridge and Band-Aids in the
medicine cabinet. Things happen, especially when your death-loving neighbors
hate you to death, and it is not unethical to care more about your own
children.”</p>

<p>“If the family lived only in its
own house, you might almost be right,” Jacob said. “And you might almost be
right if every family were equally able to give preferential treatment to its
own. But that’s not the world we live in, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“It’s the world they created.”</p>

<p>“When you look at that girl, Adia,
your heart doesn’t go out to her?”</p>

<p>“Of course it does. But like every
heart, mine is of limited size, and if it came down to Adia or Benjy, I would
pull the food from her hands to put into his. I’m not even arguing that that’s
right or good. I’m just saying it isn’t bad, because it isn’t a choice. ‘Ought
implies can,’ right? To be morally obliged to do something, you have to be able
to do it. I love Noam, Yael, and Barak, but I cannot love them as much as I
love Sam, Max, and Benjy. It’s impossible. And I love my friends, but I can’t
love them as much as I love my family. And believe it or not, I am fully
capable of loving Arabs, but not of loving them as much as I love Jews. These
are not choices.”</p>

<p>Irv genuinely and forcefully
advocated for every Jewish American of fighting age going to Israel.
Categorically. With the exception of the one he couldn’t not love more than the
others. He was a hypocrite, a father.</p>

<p>“And yet some people can choose
otherwise,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Like?”</p>

<p>“Well, the first example that comes
to mind is the first Jew: Abraham.”</p>

<p>“Senator, I served with Abraham. I
knew Abraham. Abraham was a friend of mine. Senator, you’re no Abraham.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying I could choose
otherwise. Obviously I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>Was that obvious? Irv had collapsed
the circle of concern to the youngest in his family, but was that the center?
What about oneself? Julia had asked Jacob if it made him sad that they loved
the kids more than each other. But did Jacob love his children more than he
loved himself? He ought to, but could he?</p>

<p>For other American Jews, it wasn’t
Israel’s actions that created an emotional distance, but how those actions were
perceived—those whose good faith in Israel could always be counted on either
switched sides or fell silent, and left American Jews feeling more alone than
indignantly righteous.</p>

<p>For others, it was the discomfort
of Israel being neither a scrappy underdog nor a bitty superpower capable of
bombing its Stone Age neighbors back into the pre–Stone Age. David was good.
Goliath was good. But you’d better be one or the other.</p>

<p>The prime minister had set the goal
of bringing one million American Jews to Israel with Operation Arms of Moses.
Twenty thousand went on the first day of flights—if not in the same ballpark as
the hoped-for fifty thousand, at least playing the same sport. But instead of
reaching three hundred thousand by the end of the third day, the numbers kept
halving, like box office receipts. The Times estimated that fewer than
thirty-five thousand American Jews ultimately went, and that three-quarters of
those were forty-five or older. Israel survived without them—the army pulled
back to its defensible borders and allowed disease to do the work of killing;
the tragedy lasted five hundred televised hours. But neither Israelis nor
American Jews could deny what was exposed.</p>

<p>Jacob still thought of Tel Aviv as
vibrant and cultured, and Jerusalem as irresistibly spiritual. He still felt an
almost sexual delight when he recalled the actual places where
almost-make-believe things actually happened to almost-make-believe people. The
women with guns still gave him an actual sexual delight. The ultra-Orthodox
still disgusted him, and he still couldn’t repress the misplaced gratitude he
felt for them. But something had changed.</p>

<p>What was Israel to him? What were
Israelis? They were his more aggressive, more obnoxious, more crazed, more
hairy, more muscular brothers … over there. They were ridiculous, and they were
his. They were more brave, more beautiful, more piggish and delusional, less
self-conscious, more reckless, more themselves. Over there. That’s where they
were those things. And they were his.</p>

<p>After the near-destruction, they
were still over there, but they were no longer his.</p>

<p>At each step, Jacob had made
efforts to rationalize Israel’s actions—to defend, or at least excuse, them.
And at each step, he believed what he said. Was it right to regulate incoming
aid shipments if it slowed down their delivery? It was necessary, in order to
maintain order and security. Was it right to take the Temple Mount? It was
necessary, in order to protect it. Was it right to withhold equal medical care
from anyone with equal needs? It was necessary, in order to fully care for
Israel’s citizens, who, unlike its Arab neighbors, had nowhere else to turn.
“Ought implies can.” And yet the destination to which those defensible, or at
least excusable, steps led was an Israel that sat on urgently needed aid,
conquered the most contentious Muslim territory in the world, and forced the
mothers of children who didn’t need to die to pound on locked hospital doors.
Even if there couldn’t have been another way, there ought to have been.</p>

<p>Would anyone notice, the next
morning, if the ocean widened by a foot overnight? If it widened by a mile? By
half? The horizon conceals the distance, as does the distance itself. American
Jews didn’t think of themselves as having pulled back, and would never have
described their relationship to Israel that way—not to others, not to
themselves. But even as they claimed relief and joy that Israel had triumphed,
even as they marched in parades and sent uncomfortably large checks to the
rebuilding effort, the Israeli waves took longer to reach the American shore.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, the distance between
Irv and Jacob closed. For a year, they went to shul together and said Kaddish
for Isaac, three times a day every day—or at least once, most days. And on the
days they didn’t go, they threw minyan to the wind and mourned in Irv’s living
room, facing the bookshelves, whatever their compass direction. They found a
new language—not free of jokes, irony, and argument, but no longer dependent on
them. Maybe it was a rediscovered language.</p>

<p>No one was less qualified than Irv
to help Jacob move—he didn’t know a fitted sheet from a slotted spoon—but no
one helped him more. They made trips to IKEA together, to Pottery Barn, and
Home Depot, and Gap Kids. They bought two brooms and talked about transitions,
and beginnings, and impermanence, while brushing at what felt like infinite
dust. Or they brushed in silence.</p>

<p>“It isn’t good to be alone,” Irv
said, trying to figure out the vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>“I’ll try again,” Jacob said. “I’m
just not ready yet.”</p>

<p>“I meant me.”</p>

<p>“Did something happen with Mom?”</p>

<p>“No, your mother’s the best of them
all. I’m just thinking about the people I’ve pushed away.”</p>

<p>Packing up his things had been
emotionally easier than Jacob had imagined, but the logistics were surprisingly
fraught. The problem wasn’t the volume of things—despite having accumulated
things for sixteen years, there was a surprising scarcity of things. The
problem—at the end of the day, at the end of the end of their marriage—was
addressing the question of what makes something yours and not someone else’s.
How did life reach the point where that question mattered? And what took life
so long?</p>

<p>If he’d known that he was going to
get divorced, he would have better set the table for the end—bought one of
those old-fashioned “Library of Jacob Bloch” embossers and marked the title
page of every book; perhaps stashed away money in small, unnoticeable
increments; started moving things whose absence would never be noticed, but
whose presence in his new home would make a real difference.</p>

<p>It was scary how quickly and
completely his past could be rewritten, or overwritten. All those years felt
worthwhile while they were happening, but only a few months on the other side
of them and they were a gigantic waste of time. Of a life. It was an almost
irrepressible urge of his brain to see the worst in that which had failed. To
see it as something that had failed, rather than something that had succeeded
until the end. Was he protecting himself from the loss by denying anything was
lost? Or simply achieving some pathetic emotional nonvictory by not caring?</p>

<p>When a friend would express
sympathy, why did Jacob insist on opposing it? Why did he have to turn his
decade and a half of marriage into stupid puns and ironic observations? Why
couldn’t he express to a single person—to himself—that even if he understood
that divorce was the right thing to do, even if he was hopeful about the
future, even if there was happiness ahead, it was sad? Things can be for the
best and the worst at the same time.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Three days after returning to
Israel, Tamir e-mailed Jacob from an outpost in the Negev, where his tank unit
was awaiting its next order: “Today I fired a gun, and my son fired a gun. I
never doubted the rightness of my firing a weapon to defend my home, or of Noam
doing so. But the fact of us both doing it on the same day cannot be right. Can
you understand that?”</p>

<p>“You drive the tank?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“Did you read what I wrote?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I don’t know what to
say.”</p>

<p>“I reload the ammunition.”</p>

<p>Five days later, as they turned to
the bookshelves to say Kaddish, Irv said, “So listen,” and Jacob knew something
had happened. And more, he knew it was Noam. He hadn’t seen it coming, but like
someone watching the tracks from the back of a train, he saw that it couldn’t
have been any other way.</p>

<p>Noam had been injured. Critically,
but not fatally. Rivka was with him. Tamir was on his way.</p>

<p>“How did you find out?” Jacob
asked.</p>

<p>“Tamir called me last night.”</p>

<p>“Did he ask you to tell me?”</p>

<p>“I think I’m a kind of father figure
to him.”</p>

<p>Jacob’s first instinct was to
suggest they go to Israel. He wouldn’t get on the plane to fight beside his
cousin, but he would go to sit at his cousin’s son’s bedside and offer the kind
of strength that involves only heart muscle.</p>

<p>Tamir’s first instinct was to cling
to Rivka. If someone had told him, a month or year or decade earlier, that Noam
would be wounded in a war, he would have predicted the end of his marriage. And
yet when the unimaginable happened, it was just the opposite of what he’d
imagined.</p>

<p>When the house shook with the
middle-of-the-night knocking against the door, Tamir was at a forward operating
base near Dimona; his commander woke him with the news. Later, he and Rivka
would try to pinpoint the exact moment that each learned of what happened, as
if something profound depended on who knew first, and what the amount of time
was that one parent knew and the other still believed Noam to be OK. For those
first five or thirty minutes, there would have existed a greater distance between
them than the one that separated them before they met. Perhaps if Tamir had
been home, the shared experience would have driven them apart, into competitive
suffering, misplaced fury, blame. But the apartness drew them together.</p>

<p>How many times, in those first
weeks, did he enter the room and stand by the door, unable to speak? How many
times did she ask, “Do you need anything?”</p>

<p>And he would say, “No.”</p>

<p>And she would say, “Are you sure?”</p>

<p>And he would say, “Yes,” but think,
Ask again.</p>

<p>And she would say, “I know,” but
think, Come to me.</p>

<p>And he would say, “Ask again.”</p>

<p>And she would say, “Come to me.”</p>

<p>And saying nothing, he would.</p>

<p>There they would be, side by side,
her hand on his thigh, his head resting on her chest. If they had been teenagers,
it would have looked like the beginning of love, but they’d been married for
twenty years, and it was the exhumation of love.</p>

<p>After being informed of Noam’s
injury, Tamir was given a week’s leave. He was with Rivka at the hospital three
hours later, and when darkness fell, they were told they had to go home. Rivka
instinctively went to sleep in the guest room. In the middle of the night,
Tamir entered and stood by the door.</p>

<p>“Do you need anything?” she asked.</p>

<p>And he said, “No.”</p>

<p>And she said, “Are you sure?”</p>

<p>And he said, “Yes.”</p>

<p>And she said, “I know.”</p>

<p>And he said, “Ask again.”</p>

<p>And she said, “Come to me,” and
saying nothing, he went to her.</p>

<p>He needed the distance to traverse.
So she gave it to him. Every night she would go to the guest room. Every night he
would come to her.</p>

<p>When Tamir sat with his son’s body,
he thought of what Jacob had told him about sitting with Isaac’s body, Max’s
desire to be close to it. Noam’s face was misshapen, shades of a purple that
appeared nowhere in nature, his cheeks and brow forced together by the
swelling. Why isn’t health as shocking as illness, as demanding of prayer?
Tamir had been capable of going weeks without speaking to his son, but he
wouldn’t willingly leave his son’s unconscious body.</p>

<p>Noam emerged from his coma the day
before the cease-fire. It would take time to learn the extent of his injuries:
the ways his body would never function as it once did, the psychological
damage. He hadn’t been buried alive or burned to death. But he had been broken.</p>

<p>When the cease-fire was signed,
there was no celebrating in the streets. There were no fireworks, or passed
bottles, or singing from windows. Rivka slept in the bedroom that night. The
loving distance they’d found in crisis had closed with peace. Across the
country and the world, Jews were already writing editorials blaming other
Jews—for lack of preparedness, of wisdom, of ethics, of sufficient force, of
help. The prime minister’s coalition collapsed and elections were scheduled.
Unable to sleep, Tamir took his phone from the bedside table and wrote a
one-sentence text to Jacob: We’ve won, but we’ve lost.</p>

<p>It was nine in the evening in D.C.
Jacob was in the Airbnb one-bedroom that he had been renting by the week, three
blocks from his sleeping children. He went after putting the kids down and
returned before they awoke. They knew he didn’t spend the night at home, and he
knew they knew it, but the charade felt necessary. Nothing would be harder for
Jacob than this period between houses, which lasted half a year. Everything that
was necessary was punishing: the pretending, the extreme early rising, the
aloneness.</p>

<p>Jacob’s thumb was constantly
pushing his list of contacts, as if some new person might materialize with whom
he could share the sadness he couldn’t confess. He wanted to reach out to
Tamir, but it was impossible: not after Islip, not after Noam’s injury. So when
the text from Tamir came through—We’ve won, but we’ve lost—Jacob was relieved
and grateful, but careful about expanding his shame by revealing it.</p>

<p>Won what? Lost what?</p>

<p>Won the war. Lost peace.</p>

<p>But it sounds like everyone is
accepting</p>

<p>the conditions of the armistice?</p>

<p>Peace with ourselves.</p>

<p>How is Noam?</p>

<p>He will be OK.</p>

<p>I’m so relieved to hear that.</p>

<p>When we were at your kitchen table,</p>

<p>stoned, you told me something</p>

<p>about a daytime hole in a nighttime
sky.</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>The dinosaur thing?</p>

<p>Yes, that.</p>

<p>So it was actually a nighttime hole
in a daytime sky.</p>

<p>And how?</p>

<p>Imagine shooting a bullet through
water.</p>

<p>That’s all you had to say. Now I
remember.</p>

<p>What made you think of it?</p>

<p>I can’t sleep. So instead I think.</p>

<p>I haven’t been sleeping too much,
either.</p>

<p>For people who talk about being
tired</p>

<p>as much as we do, we don’t do a lot
of sleeping.</p>

<p>We’re not going to move.</p>

<p>I didn’t think you were.</p>

<p>We were.</p>

<p>Rivka was coming around.</p>

<p>But not anymore.</p>

<p>What changed?</p>

<p>Everything. Nothing.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>We are who we are.</p>

<p>Admitting that is what changed.</p>

<p>I’m working on that myself.</p>

<p>What if it had been night?</p>

<p>When?</p>

<p>When the asteroid came.</p>

<p>Then they would have</p>

<p>become extinct at night.</p>

<p>But what would they have seen?</p>

<p>A nighttime hole in a nighttime
sky?</p>

<p>And what do you think that would
look like?</p>

<p>Maybe like nothing?</p>

<p>Over the next few years, they would
exchange brief texts and e-mails, all matter-of-fact updates, mostly about the
kids, never with any tone or tangents. Tamir didn’t come for Max’s bar mitzvah,
or Benjy’s, or Julia’s wedding (despite her kind invitation, and Jacob’s
appeal), or either Deborah’s or Irv’s funeral.</p>

<p>After the kids’ first visit to his
new house—the first and worst day of the rest of his life—Jacob closed the
door, lay with Argus for half an hour, telling him what a good dog he was, the
best dog, then sat with a cup of coffee that gave its heat to the room as he
wrote a long, never-to-be-sent e-mail to Tamir, then stood up, keys in hand,
finally ready to go to the veterinarian. The e-mail began: “We’ve lost, but
we’ve lost.”</p>

<p>Some of the losing was giving away.
Some was having things taken. Jacob was often surprised by what he found
himself clutching, and what he freely released—what he felt was his, what he
felt he needed.</p>

<p>What about that copy of Disgrace?
He’d bought it—he remembered finding it at the used bookstore in Great
Barrington one summer; he even remembered the beautiful set of Tennessee
Williams plays he didn’t buy because Julia was there, and he didn’t want to be
forced to confront his desire to own books he had no intention of reading.</p>

<p>Julia had taken Disgrace from his
bedside table, on the grounds of it having sat there untouched for more than a
year. (Untouched was her word. Unread would have been his.) Did his having
bought it entitle him to it? Did her having read—touched—it? Did her having
touched and read it forfeit her claim to it, as it was now his to touch and
read? Such thoughts felt disgraceful. The only way to be spared them was to
give away everything, but only a more enlightened or stupid person would rub
his palms together and think, They’re only things.</p>

<p>What about the blue vase on the
mantel? Her parents had given it to him as a gift. Not to them, but to him. It
was a birthday present. Or Father’s Day. He could remember, at least, that it
was a gift placed in his hands, with an attached card addressed to him, that it
had been carefully chosen for him, because they prided themselves on knowing him,
which, to their credit, they did.</p>

<p>Was it somehow ungenerous to assume
ownership of something paid for by her parents, which, while undeniably given
to him, was clearly intended for their shared home? And beautiful as the vase
was, did he want that psychic energy in his sanctuary and symbol of new
beginnings? Would it really give his flowers the best chance of blooming?</p>

<p>Most things he could let go of:</p>

<p>He loved the Big Red Chair, curled
into whose corduroy he’d done virtually all his reading in the last dozen
years. Hadn’t it absorbed something? Taken on qualities beyond chairness? Was
the sweat stain on the back the only remnant of all that experience? What was
trapped in the wide wales? Let it go, he thought.</p>

<p>The silverware. It had brought food
to his mouth, to his children’s mouths. The most fundamental of all human
activities, that which we can’t live without. He had washed them in the sink
before positioning them in the dishwasher. He had unbent the spoons after Sam’s
clumsy psychokinesis; used knives to pry off the lids of paint cans and scrape
hardened who-knows-what from the sink; guided forks down the back of his shirt
to scratch an out-of-reach itch. Let them go. Let it all go until it’s all
gone.</p>

<p>The photo albums. He’d have liked
some of those. But they shouldn’t be separated any more than the volumes of the
Grove Encyclopedia of Art. And there was no way around the fact that Julia had
taken almost all the pictures: observe her absence among them. Was her absence
her claim to ownership?</p>

<p>The growth chart, inscribed on the
kitchen doorframe. On New Year’s and Jewish New Year’s, Jacob would make a
production of calling everyone to be measured. They stood facing out, backs
flat as surfboards, never on tiptoes but always willing tallness. Jacob pressed
a black Sharpie flush with the tops of their heads and drew a two-inch line.
Then the initials and date. The first measurement was SB 01/01/05. The last was
BB 01/01/16. Between them, a couple dozen lines. What did it look like? A tiny
ladder for tiny angels to ascend and descend? The frets on the instrument
playing the sound of life passing?</p>

<p>He would have been happy enough to
take nothing and simply start again at the beginning. They’re only things. But
that wouldn’t be fair. More, it would be unfair. Very quickly, the fairness and
unfairness took on more importance than the things themselves. That feeling of
aggrievement reached its peak when they started talking about amounts of money
that simply didn’t matter. One spring afternoon, cherry blossoms stuck to the
window, Dr. Silvers told him, “Whatever the conditions of your life, you’re
never going to be happy if you use the word unfair as often as you do.” So he
tried to let it all go—the things, and the ideas he imbued them with. He would
begin again.</p>

<p>The first purchases for the new
house were beds for the kids. Because Benjy’s room was on the small side, he
needed a bed with storage drawers. Perhaps those were actually hard to find, or
perhaps Jacob made the task hard. He spent three full days researching online
and visiting stores, and ended up with something quite nice (from the
offensively misnamed Design Within Reach), made of solid oak, which cost more
than three thousand dollars. Plus tax, plus delivery.</p>

<p>The bed obviously needed a
mattress—talk about obvious—and the mattress obviously had to be organic—talk
about unobvious—because Julia would ask if it was, and then, not trusting his
answer, would peel back the sheets and have a look. Would it kill him simply to
say, “I went with something easy?” Yes, it would. But why? For fear of
disappointing her? For fear of her? Because she was right, and it mattered what
chemicals children spend nearly half of their lives pressed up against? Another
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The mattress needed sheets,
obviously, but first it needed a mattress cover, because even though Benjy was
on the verge of the end of nighttime accidents, he was still on the wrong side
of that verge—it occurred to Jacob that the divorce might even inspire
regression—and one such accident could effectively ruin the thousand-dollar
organic mattress. So another hundred and fifty dollars. And then those sheets.
The plural is not only for the various kinds of sheet necessary to define a
sheet set, but for the second sheet set, because that’s what people get. He
often found himself at the mercy of such logic: this has to be done in such and
such way because it has to, because it’s what people do. People get two pieces
of silverware for every one they will ever use. People buy esoteric vinegars
for salads that they might make once, if ever. And why is the functionality of
the fork so underrecognized? With a simple fork, one doesn’t need a whisk, a
spatula, salad tongs (two forks for that), a “masher,” or pretty much any other
highly specialized kitchen utensil whose real function is to be bought. He
found his share of peace by resolving that if he was going to buy things he
didn’t need, at least he was going to get crummy versions of them.</p>

<p>Imagine arriving in the afterlife
and not knowing if you were in heaven or hell.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” you ask a passing
angel, “where am I?”</p>

<p>“You’re gonna wanna ask the angel
at the information desk.”</p>

<p>“And where would that be?”</p>

<p>But he’s gone.</p>

<p>You look around. A strong case
could be made for it being heaven. A strong case could be made for it being
hell. That is what IKEA is like.</p>

<p>By the time he was finished
preparing his new house for the boys, Jacob had made half a dozen trips to
IKEA, and even then he couldn’t discern if, on balance, he loved or loathed it.</p>

<p>He loathed the particleboard, the
bookcases that needed books to keep them from floating away.</p>

<p>He loved imagining the scrutiny
that had to be applied to every detail—the shortest functional length of a
dowel that will be reproduced eighty million times—in order to sell things for
prices that verged on magical.</p>

<p>He loathed the experience of
passing someone whose cart’s contents were not only identical to his, but
identically stacked. And he loathed the carts: three mortal enemies and one
palsy case for wheels, and turning radiuses like rainbows—not the shape, but
actual rainbows.</p>

<p>He loved the unexpected
object—beautifully designed, perfectly named, and actually made from materials
denser than shaving cream. That black marble Ädelsten mortar and pestle. Was it
a loss leader? An act of love?</p>

<p>He loathed the machine that punched
that poor chair over and over, punched it all day every day and probably
through the night, confirming both the resilience of the chair and the
existence of evil.</p>

<p>Jacob sat himself on a sofa—green
velvet-like upholstery holding in whatever is the opposite of kelp and pony
hair—and closed his eyes. He’d been having a hard time falling asleep. For a
long time. But this felt OK. Despite the river of strangers passing in front of
him, and occasionally sitting beside him to test the comfort, this felt safe.
He was in his own world in that world that was in its own world in the world.
Everyone was looking for something, but there was an endless supply, so no
one’s gratification had to come at anyone else’s expense—there was no need to
fight, no need even to disagree. So what that it was utterly soulless? Maybe
heaven wasn’t populated by souls, but emptied of them? Maybe this was fairness?</p>

<p>He was awoken by what he at first
thought was the punching of that depraved machine, as if his resiliency were
being violently challenged again and again and again. But it was just the
tapping of a friendly angel.</p>

<p>“We’re closing in ten,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m really sorry,” he said.</p>

<p>She asked, “For what?”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>By the time of the earthquake,
Jacob would walk downstairs every morning not wondering if Argus had pooped,
but where and with what solidity. It was a horrible way to start a day, and
Jacob knew it wasn’t Argus’s fault, but when time was of the essence and kids
weren’t cooperating robotically, poop in four places could force a meltdown.</p>

<p>“Jesus Christ, Argus!”</p>

<p>And then one of the kids would come
to Argus’s rescue: “He can’t help it.”</p>

<p>And then Jacob would feel
miserable.</p>

<p>Argus made Rorschachs of persians
and orientals, relocated the stuffing of upholstered furniture to closets and
his stomach, and scratched wood floors like Grand Wizard Theodore. But he was
theirs.</p>

<p>Everything would have been so much
easier if Argus were suffering—not just uncomfortable, but in deep pain. Or if
a vet could find cancer, or heart disease, even kidney failure.</p>

<p>When Jacob told Julia he was going
to Israel to fight, she told him he had to put down Argus first. He didn’t, and
she didn’t mention it again. But when he came home from not leaving, it was an
open, if invisible, wound.</p>

<p>In the following months, Argus’s
condition worsened along with everything else. He started whining for no
obvious reason, paced before sitting down, ate less and less until he hardly
ate at all.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Julia and the boys would be there
any minute. Jacob wandered through the house, noticing the imperfections,
adding to the infinite mental punch list of things that should be taken care
of: the cracked grout in the dripping shower; the sloppy bit of overpainting
where the hallway wall met the floor; the torqued vent in the dining room
ceiling; the fussy bedroom window.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang. Then rang again.
Then rang again.</p>

<p>“Coming! Coming!”</p>

<p>He opened the door to smiles.</p>

<p>“Your doorbell sounds weird,” Max
said.</p>

<p>Your doorbell.</p>

<p>“It does sound a little weird.
Weird good? Or weird bad?”</p>

<p>“Maybe weird good?” Max said, and
that might have been his opinion, but it might have been kindness.</p>

<p>“Come in,” Jacob said. “Come. I
have some great snacks—Cheddar Bunnies; the truffle cheese you like, Benjy;
those lime tortilla chips, Max. And the whole line of Italian sodas: aranciata,
limonata, pompelmo, clementine.”</p>

<p>“We’re good,” Sam said, smiling as
if for a family photo.</p>

<p>“I’ve never even heard of
pompelmo,” Max said.</p>

<p>“Neither had I,” Jacob said. “But
we’ve got it.”</p>

<p>“I love this place,” Julia said,
quite sincerely and convincingly, despite it being a scripted line. They’d
rehearsed the visit, just as they’d rehearsed the divorce conversation, and how
to share the new schedule of moving between houses, and so many other
experiences too painful to have only once.</p>

<p>“So do you guys want a tour? Or do
you want to just explore it yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Maybe explore?” Sam said.</p>

<p>“Go on. Your names are on the doors
of your rooms, so you can’t miss them.”</p>

<p>He heard himself.</p>

<p>The boys went upstairs, slowly,
deliberately. They didn’t speak, but Jacob could hear them touching things.</p>

<p>Julia hung back, and waited until
the kids were on the third floor before saying, “So far, so good.”</p>

<p>“You think?”</p>

<p>“I do,” she said. “But it’ll take
time.”</p>

<p>Jacob wondered what Tamir would
have to say about the house, should he ever see it. What would Isaac have said?
He spared himself the move to the Jewish Home, unaware that he was also sparing
himself Jacob’s move—and sparing Jacob.</p>

<p>Jacob led Julia into what would
become the living room—emptier now than if it had never been enclosed by walls.
They sat on the only piece of furniture, the green sofa that Jacob had fallen
asleep on a few weeks before. Not that exact sofa, but one of its two million
identical siblings.</p>

<p>“Dusty,” she said. And then:
“Sorry.”</p>

<p>“No, it is. Horribly.”</p>

<p>“You have a vacuum?”</p>

<p>“I got the kind we have,” Jacob
said. “We had? You have? And I mop it, too. All the time, it feels like.”</p>

<p>“There’s dust in the air, from the
work. It keeps settling.”</p>

<p>“How does one get dust out of the
air?”</p>

<p>“Just keep doing what you’re
doing,” she said.</p>

<p>“And expect a different result?
Isn’t that the definition of insanity?”</p>

<p>“Do you have a Swiffer duster?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get you one. They’re really
useful.”</p>

<p>“I can get it if you send me the
link.”</p>

<p>“At that point it’s easier for me
to just get it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel OK about Argus?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You should.”</p>

<p>“My feelings have never once cared
about what they should be.”</p>

<p>“You’re good, Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Compared to what?”</p>

<p>“Compared to other men.”</p>

<p>“I feel like I’m bailing water with
a colander.”</p>

<p>“If life were easy, everyone would
do it.”</p>

<p>“Everyone does.”</p>

<p>“Think about how many trillions of
trillions of people are never born for every one who is.”</p>

<p>“Or just think about my
grandfather.”</p>

<p>“I often do,” she said. Her eyes
raised, and scanned the room. “I don’t know if it’s annoying or helpful when I
mention things—”</p>

<p>“Why so binary?”</p>

<p>“Right. Well. The walls are rather
dark.”</p>

<p>“I know. They are, right?”</p>

<p>“Disconsolate.”</p>

<p>“I hired a colorist.”</p>

<p>“You’re kidding.”</p>

<p>“I used that paint you like. Farrow
whatever.”</p>

<p>“Farrow and Ball.”</p>

<p>“And they offered a colorist’s
services, I assumed as a courtesy because I was buying so much of their
overpriced paint. And then I got a bill for twenty-five hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Two thousand five hundred.
And I feel like I’m living underneath a Union kepi.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“Those Civil War hats. I’ve been
listening to this history of—”</p>

<p>“You should have asked me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t afford you.”</p>

<p>“Would have been pro bono.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t my father teach you there’s
no such thing as a free colorist?”</p>

<p>“There’s paper everywhere,” Benjy
said, coming down the stairs. He seemed buoyant, unfazed.</p>

<p>“It’s just protecting the floor
while they finish the work,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“I’m going to trip a lot.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be long gone by the time you
live here. The paper on the floor, the ladders, the dust. All of it will be
gone.”</p>

<p>Max and Sam came back down.</p>

<p>“Can I have a mini-fridge in my
room?” Max asked.</p>

<p>“Definitely,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“For what?” Julia asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think there’s too much
paper on the floors?” Benjy asked his brothers.</p>

<p>“For all those Italian sodas.”</p>

<p>“I think Dad intended those as
something special for your first time here.”</p>

<p>“Dad?”</p>

<p>“They would definitely not be an
everyday beverage.”</p>

<p>“Sam, don’t you think the paper on
the floor is bad?”</p>

<p>“Fine, so I could keep the dead
rats.”</p>

<p>“Dead rats?”</p>

<p>“I gave the OK for a python,” Jacob
said, “and that’s what they eat.”</p>

<p>“Actually, they’d probably have to
be frozen,” Max said. “And I don’t think those mini-fridges have little freezer
sections in them.”</p>

<p>“Why would you want a python?”
Julia asked.</p>

<p>“Because I’ve wanted a python
forever, because they’re amazing, and Dad said now that we had the new house we
could finally get one.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t anybody care that I’m
going to trip all the time?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>And then Sam, who had been quiet
for an uncharacteristically long time, said, “My room seems nice. Thanks, Dad.”</p>

<p>And that was the hardest thing for
Jacob to hear. Julia saw that he needed help, and stepped in.</p>

<p>“So,” she said, clapping her hands
once, inadvertently raising more dust, “Dad and I were thinking it would be
nice to give this house a name.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just Dad’s House?”</p>

<p>“Right,” Jacob said, composing
himself with an imitation of optimism. “But we all want to think of it as one
of our family’s two houses.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, the one that you live in. As
opposed to the one that Mom lives in.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like this house,” Benjy
said, verbally cutting the lines of Jacob’s emotional brakes.</p>

<p>“You will,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this house.”</p>

<p>“I promise you will.”</p>

<p>Jacob felt himself skidding out. It
was unfair that he had to move, unfair that he was perceived as the one who
left; that all this dust was his was unfair. But he also felt his dependency on
Julia’s efforts. He couldn’t do this without her. He couldn’t live without her
without her.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be great,” she said,
as if she could keep blowing her optimism into the punctured balloon of Benjy’s
happiness and it would keep its shape. “Dad said there’s even room for a
Ping-Pong table upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Totally,” Jacob said. “And I’ve
been trolling eBay for an old Skee-Ball machine.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean trolling,” Max
said. “You mean trawling.”</p>

<p>“Although,” Sam said, suddenly
enlivened, “did you know that trolling actually comes from trawling. Not from,
like, trolls?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” Max said, grateful for
that little bit of knowledge. “I’d always assumed trolls.”</p>

<p>“Right?”</p>

<p>The moment of normality suggested a
normal life.</p>

<p>“What’s Skee-Ball?” Benjy asked.</p>

<p>“It’s kind of a combination of
bowling and darts,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“That’s hard for me to imagine.”</p>

<p>“Like at Chuck E. Cheese’s.”</p>

<p>“Ah, right.”</p>

<p>A normal life? Was all this
upheaval justified by that ambition?</p>

<p>“How about Arcade House?” Max
suggested.</p>

<p>“Too much like Arcade Fire,” Sam
said.</p>

<p>“It’s very dusty,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“The dust won’t be here.”</p>

<p>“How about Davenport House?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s on Davenport Street.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like an old-age home.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what’s wrong about
calling it Dad’s House,” Sam said. “We can pretend it’s something else, but
that’s what it is.”</p>

<p>“Paper House,” Benjy said, a bit to
himself, a bit to no one.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s so much paper
everywhere.”</p>

<p>“But the paper will be gone by the
time you move in,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“And paper is what you write on,
and you’re a writer.”</p>

<p>“He writes on a computer,” Sam
said.</p>

<p>“And paper rips and burns easily.”</p>

<p>“Why would you want to name a house
after something that rips and burns easily?”</p>

<p>“Give him a break, Max.”</p>

<p>“What did I say?”</p>

<p>“Forget it,” Jacob said. “We can
just call it 2328, after the address.”</p>

<p>“No,” Julia said, “don’t forget it.
It’s a nice idea, and we’re five intelligent people. We can do it.”</p>

<p>The five intelligent people
thought. They applied their intelligence to what was ultimately not a question
of intelligence, like applying a Phillips-head screwdriver to a crossword
puzzle.</p>

<p>Some religions emphasize inner
peace, some the avoidance of sin, some praise. Judaism emphasizes
intelligence—textually, ritualistically, and culturally. Everything is
learning, everything preparation, perpetually filling the mental toolbox until
we are prepared for any situation (and it is too heavy to carry). Jews make up
0.2 percent of the world’s population, but have been awarded 22 percent of all
Nobel Prizes—24 percent if you don’t include the Peace Prize. And with no Nobel
for Being Exterminated, there was a decade when Jews wouldn’t have had much of
a chance, so the practical percentage is yet higher. Why? It’s not because Jews
are any smarter than anyone else; it’s because Jews put their emphasis on the
kinds of things Stockholm rewards. Jews have been training for Nobel Prizes for
thousands of years. But if there were Nobel Prizes for Contentment, for Feeling
Safe, or for the Ability to Let Go, that 22 percent—24 percent without
Peace—would need a parachute.</p>

<p>“I still think we should call it
Dad’s House,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“But it’s not just my house. It’s
our house.”</p>

<p>“We can’t call it Our House,” Sam
said, “because the other house is our house, too.”</p>

<p>“Clock House?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Pompelmo House?”</p>

<p>“Anonymous House?”</p>

<p>“Dusty House?”</p>

<p>“To be continued,” Julia said as
she checked her phone for the time. “I’ve got to get these guys to haircuts.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Jacob said, knowing the
inevitable, and wanting to defer it, if only for another few minutes. “Does
anyone want a snack or drink first?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to be late,” Julia
said. And then: “Everybody say ’bye to Argus.”</p>

<p>“Later, Argus.”</p>

<p>“Ciao, Argo.”</p>

<p>“A good goodbye,” she said.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“It’s his first night in the new
house,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“New House?” Sam suggested.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Jacob said. “Although it
won’t be new for long.”</p>

<p>“We can change the name at that
point,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“Like the Old-New Synagogue in
Prague,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“Or move,” Benjy said.</p>

<p>“No more moving,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Gotta go,” Julia said to the kids.</p>

<p>The kids said good goodbyes to
Argus, and then Julia knelt down to be face-to-face with him. “Take care, hairy
man.”</p>

<p>She showed nothing, nothing that
anyone but Jacob could see. But he could see. He couldn’t describe the
giveaway—her face revealed nothing, her body revealed nothing, and there was
nothing in her voice—but she gave it all away. He could only ever manage
repression. She was capable of composure. And he was in awe of it. She did it
for the kids. She did it for Argus. But how did she do it?</p>

<p>“OK,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“OK,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“I know what we should do,” Benjy
said.</p>

<p>“We should go,” Julia said.</p>

<p>“No. We should walk around the
house with our eyes closed. Like we used to do on Shabbat.”</p>

<p>“How about next time you’re here?”
Jacob said.</p>

<p>Sam stepped forward, into the space
of his adulthood: “Dad, we can do this for him.”</p>

<p>And with that, Julia put down her
bag. And Jacob took his hands from his pockets. No one watched anyone close
their eyes, because that would have betrayed the spirit of the ritual. And no
one peeked, because there was an instinct stronger than that instinct.</p>

<p>It was fun at first; it was funny.
The nostalgia was sweet and untinged. The kids bumped into things on purpose,
and made boy noises, and laughed a lot. But then, without anyone intending it,
or noticing the shift, a silence bloomed. No one stopped talking, but there was
no more talking. No one suppressed a laugh, but there was no more laughing. It
went on for a long time—it felt like a different amount of time to each—the
five of them like ghosts, or explorers, or newborns. No one knew if anyone’s
arms were extended for protection. No one knew if anyone crawled, or did leg
sweeps for obstacles, or ran a finger against a wall that he kept to his right
at all times. Julia’s foot touched the leg of a folding chair. Sam found a
light switch, pinched it between his thumb and forefinger, searched for the
place between off and on. Max felt a thrill as his hands explored the stovetop.
Julia opened her eyes; they were greeted by Jacob’s open eyes.</p>

<p>“I figured it out,” Benjy said, old
enough to know that the world doesn’t disappear when you aren’t looking at it.</p>

<p>“What did you figure out?” Julia
asked from across the room, not betraying him by looking at him.</p>

<p>“Wailing House.”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Jacob didn’t need anything when he
made his final visit to IKEA. He’d just become so accustomed to IKEA satisfying
his needs—hand towels for the top bathroom, a pot of lamb’s ears, freestanding
acrylic picture frames—that he came to believe IKEA knew his needs better than
he did, in the same way that he scheduled physicals because the doctor knew
better than Jacob if Jacob was sick.</p>

<p>He picked up a bright red step
stool, a garlic press, three toilet brushes, a drying rack for laundry, a
drying rack for dishes, half a dozen felt storage boxes that would be perfect
for some still-unknown purpose, a level (despite never once, in the previous
forty-two years, having had need of a level), a doormat, two letter trays, oven
mitts, several glass jars with airtight seals for the storage (and attractive
display) of things like beans and lentils and split peas and popcorn and quinoa
and rice, more hangers, LED light strings to connect the corners of Benjy’s
room, pedal bins for each bathroom, a crappy umbrella that wouldn’t survive two
storms but would survive one. He was among the textiles, spreading his fingers
in a faux sheepskin, when he heard his name.</p>

<p>“Jacob?”</p>

<p>He turned to face a quite beautiful
woman: warm brown eyes like old leather; a gold locket that drew his gaze to
the top of her tight, unmottled cleavage; bracelets halfway down her hands as
if she’d once been bigger. What was in that locket? He knew her, or had known
her.</p>

<p>“Maggie,” she said. “Silliman.”</p>

<p>“Hi, Maggie.”</p>

<p>She smiled a smile to bring a
thousand ships to harbor.</p>

<p>“Dylan and Sam went to nursery
school together. Leah and Melissa’s class.”</p>

<p>“Right. Of course.”</p>

<p>“It’s been a decade,” she said
kindly.</p>

<p>“No, I remember.”</p>

<p>“I thought I saw you. Way back in
living rooms. But I lost you in the shuffle. And I wasn’t sure. But when I saw
you here, I knew.”</p>

<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>“I’m so relieved you’re home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t live here,” Jacob
said, his reflexive flirtatiousness stimulating the thought that maybe she was
the one whose husband had an aneurysm in the middle of the school year. “Just
purchasing a few things for my actual home.”</p>

<p>She didn’t laugh. She was visibly
moved. Was she the one for whom Julia brought over all those dinners?</p>

<p>“There was a list of everyone who
went.”</p>

<p>“Went?”</p>

<p>“To Israel. They hung it outside
the sanctuary.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that,” he said.</p>

<p>“I never used to pray. Never. But I
started going. A lot of people did. Most mornings the sanctuary was full.
Anyway, I looked at it every day.”</p>

<p>He thought, I can still tell the
truth, but only now. After this, an awkward misunderstanding will be a lie that
is worse than what it is concealing.</p>

<p>“I had no idea,” he said.</p>

<p>And there are smaller lies
available (that I was turned back at the airport), and even half-truths (that
there was a crisis at home that needed me even more than the crisis abroad).</p>

<p>“There were two lists, actually:
one with the names of those who went to fight, and one with the names of those
who died. Everyone on the second list was on the first list, obviously.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s really nice to see you
again,” Jacob said, hating the truth, hating the lie, and knowing nothing
between.</p>

<p>“They never took them down. Maybe
they’re supposed to be some kind of memorial? Or maybe even though the war is
over, it somehow isn’t?”</p>

<p>“Hard to say.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“In Israel. Were you in logistics?
Infantry? I don’t know the terminology.”</p>

<p>“I was in a tank unit.”</p>

<p>Her eyes widened.</p>

<p>“Being in a tank must have been
terrifying.”</p>

<p>“Not as terrifying as being outside
of one.”</p>

<p>She didn’t laugh. She brought her
fingers to her mouth and said, “You didn’t drive it, did you?”</p>

<p>“No. That requires a lot of
training and experience. I reloaded the ammunition.”</p>

<p>“Sounds grueling.”</p>

<p>“I guess it was.”</p>

<p>“And did you see battle? Is that
the right way to put it? See battle?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to put things, either.
I was just a body. But yes, I saw battle. I imagine everyone did.”</p>

<p>The sentence advanced, but his mind
stayed back with I was just a body.</p>

<p>“Did you ever feel that you were in
grave danger?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I was feeling
much of anything. It might sound clichéd, but there wasn’t time to be afraid.”</p>

<p>Without looking down, she took the
locket between her thumb and forefinger. Her hand knew exactly where it would
be.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she said. “I’m asking
too much.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s not it,” he said,
seizing her offer of regret as an escape route. “I just have to get out of here
in time to pick up Sam.”</p>

<p>“Is he well?”</p>

<p>“He’s doing great. Thank you for
asking. And—?”</p>

<p>“Dylan.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Dylan is having a hard time.”</p>

<p>“Oh no. I’m sorry to hear that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” she began, but then shook
the thought away.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I was just going to say, maybe if
it’s not too much to ask, you could come by sometime.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure Sam would like that.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, a vein in her neck
suddenly visible, or suddenly noticed. “You. I meant you.”</p>

<p>Jacob no longer understood. Could
she be as brazen as she sounded? Or was she mistaking him for a parent who was
a child psychologist, as he’d mistaken her for the wife of an aneurysm victim?
He was attracted to her, he wanted her, but this couldn’t go any further.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he said. “I could come by.”</p>

<p>“Maybe if you shared some of your
experiences, it would make things less abstract for him. Less scary. I think
part of what’s so hard right now is not having any details.”</p>

<p>“That makes sense.”</p>

<p>Although it didn’t.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have to take a lot of
your time. I’m not asking you to take him on or anything.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t sound like it.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good man,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” he said.</p>

<p>And then, finally, she laughed.
“Well, I suppose only you know for sure. But you seem good.”</p>

<p>Once, Benjy called Jacob back into
his room after tuck-in and asked, “Are there things that don’t have names?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Jacob said, “lots of
things.”</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>“Like this headboard.”</p>

<p>“It’s called headboard.”</p>

<p>“Headboard is what it is. But it
doesn’t have its own name.”</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>“Good night, love.”</p>

<p>“Let’s give them names.”</p>

<p>“That was the first man’s first
job, you know.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Adam. From Adam and Eve. God told
him to name the animals.”</p>

<p>“We named Argus.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“But the first man was a monkey,
right? So did he name himself?”</p>

<p>“Could be.”</p>

<p>“I want to name everything.”</p>

<p>“That would be a lot of work.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“OK. But starting tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“OK.”</p>

<p>Jacob went to the threshold and
waited, as he always did, and Benjy called him back, as he always did.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Are there names that don’t have
things?”</p>

<p>Names like the names on the
gravestones in the suicide ghetto. Names like the names on the memorial wall,
which Jacob had rearranged into words. Names like the names in his
never-to-be-shared show. Jacob had written thousands and thousands of pages
about his life, but it wasn’t until that moment, her pulse visible in her neck,
his choice finally visible, that he questioned if he was worthy of a word.</p>

<p>“OK,” she said, and smiled, and
nodded, and took a half step away. “Please say hello to Julia for me.”</p>

<p>“I will,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>He left the overflowing cartful of
things where it was, followed the arrows back through LIVING ROOM, WORK SPACE,
KITCHEN, DINING, and BEDROOM to the parking lot. He drove straight to the
synagogue. Indeed, the lists were still there. But his name wasn’t among those
who had gone. He double- and triple-checked.</p>

<p>So what had just happened?</p>

<p>Had she misremembered?</p>

<p>Or maybe she had seen the Islip
photograph in the newspaper and was remembering his image when she thought she
was remembering his name?</p>

<p>Maybe she was giving Jacob the
benefit of the doubt?</p>

<p>Maybe she knew everything and was
destroying the life he’d saved?</p>

<p>With the hand that had cut three
umbilical cords, he touched the names of the dead.</p>

<p>“Only you know for sure,” she had
said.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>There were dozens of veterinarians
far closer than Gaithersburg, Maryland, that he hadn’t consulted—it felt
essential to go to someone they hadn’t seen, for both Argus’s sake and
Jacob’s—but he needed to create some distance from home.</p>

<p>On the way there, he took Argus to
a rest-stop McDonald’s. He brought the food to a grassy hill beside the lot,
and tried to feed Argus McNuggets, but Argus just turned away. Jacob kept
stroking him under the chin, as he liked.</p>

<p>Life is precious, Jacob thought. It
is the most important of all thoughts, and the most obvious, and the most
difficult to remember to have. He thought: How different my life would have
been if I could have had that thought before I was forced to.</p>

<p>They drove with the windows halfway
down, Dan Carlin’s “Hardcore History: Blueprint for Armageddon II” blaring. In
the context of an argument Carlin was making about the significance of World
War I, he spoke about a concept called the Great Filter—the moment at which a
civilization becomes capable of destroying itself. Many mark 1945, and the use
of nuclear weapons, as humanity’s Great Filter. Carlin argued it was 1914, with
the worldwide proliferation of mechanized warfare. He then digressed a bit, as
was his genius, to Fermi’s paradox. During a lunch break at Los Alamos, in
1950, a handful of the world’s greatest physicists were joking about a recent
spate of UFO sightings. Taking the matter ironically-seriously, they unfolded a
paper napkin and tried to calculate the probability of intelligent life
existing elsewhere. Assume there are 1024 stars in the observable universe—ten
thousand stars for every grain of sand on Earth. Using the most conservative
estimates, there are approximately one hundred billion billion Earth-like
planets—one hundred for each grain of sand on Earth. If, after billions of
years in existence, one percent of those developed life, and one percent of
those developed intelligent life, there should be ten million billion
intelligent civilizations in the universe—one hundred thousand just in our
galaxy. Clearly we are not alone.</p>

<p>But then Enrico Fermi, the most
celebrated and brilliant physicist at the table, spoke for the first time: “So
where is everybody?” If they ought to be there, and they aren’t there, why
aren’t they there? Clearly we are alone.</p>

<p>There are many responses to this
paradox: that there’s plenty of intelligent life in the universe, just no way
of knowing about it because we’re too far from one another for any messages to
reach; that humans aren’t listening properly; that other life is too alien to
recognize, or to recognize us; that everyone is listening and no one adequately
transmitting. Each of these struck Jacob as unbearably poetic: we’re too far
for messages to reach; we aren’t listening properly; no one is adequately
transmitting. Then Carlin returned to the notion of the Great Filter. At a
certain point, every civilization will become capable of destroying itself (on
purpose, or by accident), and face a kind of pass/fail test—whether it is
possible to have the ability to commit suicide, and not commit suicide.</p>

<p>When did Isaac reach his Great
Filter?</p>

<p>When did Israel?</p>

<p>When did Jacob and Julia’s marriage?</p>

<p>When did Jacob?</p>

<p>He parked the car and walked Argus
to the clinic door. No leash necessary anymore. Argus wasn’t going anywhere.
And yet Jacob wished he’d had a leash then, so it wouldn’t feel like Argus was
unknowingly walking himself to his own end. It would have been horrible to lead
him there, but less horrible.</p>

<p>The place was called Hope Clinic.
Somehow Jacob had forgotten that, or never bothered to know it. It reminded him
of a Kafka quote: “Oh, there is hope, an infinite amount of hope, just not for
us.” Just not for you, Argus.</p>

<p>They went to the reception desk.</p>

<p>“This is a checkup?” the secretary
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jacob responded.</p>

<p>He just couldn’t. He wasn’t ready.
He’d have another chance with the vet.</p>

<p>Jacob browsed a magazine without
focusing his eyes. He remembered the first time one of his kids called him out
for looking at his phone instead of at them.</p>

<p>“That’s my boy,” he said to Argus,
scratching under his chin. Had he ever called him his boy before?</p>

<p>The tech came and led them to an
examination room in the back. The vet took forever, and Jacob offered Argus
treats from the glass jar on the counter. But Argus just turned away.</p>

<p>“You’re good,” Jacob told him,
trying to be as calming as Max had been. “You’re so good.”</p>

<p>We live in the world, Jacob
thought. That thought always seemed to insert itself, usually in opposition to
the word ideally. Ideally, we would make sandwiches at homeless shelters every
weekend, and learn instruments late in life, and stop thinking about the middle
of life as late in life, and use some mental resource other than Google, and
some physical resource other than Amazon, and permanently retire mac and
cheese, and give at least a quarter of the time and attention to aging
relatives that they deserve, and never put a child in front of a screen. But we
live in the world, and in the world there’s soccer practice, and speech
therapy, and grocery shopping, and homework, and keeping the house respectably
clean, and money, and moods, and fatigue, and also we’re only human, and humans
not only need but deserve things like time with a coffee and the paper, and
seeing friends, and taking breathers, so as nice as that idea is, there’s just
no way we can make it happen. Ought to, but can’t.</p>

<p>Over and over and over: We live in
the world.</p>

<p>Finally, the vet came. He was an
old man, maybe eighty. Old and old-fashioned: a pocket square in his white
coat, a stethoscope around his neck. His handshake was arresting: so much
softness to get through before the bone.</p>

<p>“What brings you here today?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t explain?”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“I’d called.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell me yourself.”</p>

<p>Was this a ploy? Like when they
make a young woman listen to a fetal heartbeat before she can get an abortion?</p>

<p>He wasn’t ready.</p>

<p>“So, my dog has been suffering for
a long time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, OK,” the vet said, clicking
shut the pen with which he was about to start filling out a form. “And what’s
the name of your dog?”</p>

<p>“Argus.”</p>

<p>“‘This is the dog of a man who died
far away,’” the vet bellowed.</p>

<p>“Impressive.”</p>

<p>“I was a classics professor in
another life.”</p>

<p>“With a photographic memory?”</p>

<p>“There’s actually no such thing.
But I did love Homer.” He slowly lowered himself onto a knee. “Hello, Argus.”
He held the sides of Argus’s face and looked into his eyes. “It’s not my
favorite expression,” he said, still looking at Argus. “Putting down. I prefer
letting go.”</p>

<p>“I prefer that, too,” Jacob said,
as grateful as he’d ever been.</p>

<p>“Are you in pain, Argus?”</p>

<p>“He whines a lot, sometimes through
the night. And he has a hard time getting up and down.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound good.”</p>

<p>“It’s been going on for quite a
while, but it’s gotten worse in the last half a year. He’s barely eating. And
he’s incontinent.”</p>

<p>“None of that is good news.”</p>

<p>News. It was the first time since
the earthquake he’d heard anything else referred to as news.</p>

<p>“Our vet, back in D.C., gave him a
couple of months, but it’s been almost half a year.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fighter,” the vet said to
Argus, “aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Jacob didn’t like that. He didn’t
like thinking of Argus fighting for the life that was about to be taken from
him. And while he knew that age and illness were what Argus was fighting
against, there they were: Argus and Jacob, and a vet to carry out Jacob’s
wishes at the expense of Argus’s. It wasn’t that simple. Jacob knew it wasn’t.
But he also knew there was a sense in which it was exactly that simple. There
is no way to communicate to a dog that one is sorry that we live in the world
but it is the only place that one can live. Or maybe there is no way not to
communicate that.</p>

<p>The vet looked into Argus’s eyes
for another few moments, now in silence.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” Jacob asked.</p>

<p>“What do I think?”</p>

<p>“About this situation?”</p>

<p>“I think you know this dog better
than anyone, and certainly better than some old vet who’s spent a total of five
minutes with him.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“In my experience, and I’ve had a
lot of it, people know when it’s time.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine ever knowing. But
I think that just says something about me, rather than Argus’s condition.”</p>

<p>“Might be.”</p>

<p>“I feel that it’s time. But I don’t
know that it’s time.”</p>

<p>“OK,” the vet said, rising. “OK.”</p>

<p>He took a syringe from a glass jar
on the counter—a jar directly beside the treats—and a small vial from a
cabinet.</p>

<p>“This is a very simple procedure,
and I can assure you that Argus will neither anticipate it nor feel any pain
whatsoever, other than the pinch of the needle, although I’m pretty good at
concealing that. Within a second or two, he’ll pass. I’ll just warn you that
the moment of death can be unpleasant. Usually it’s just like falling asleep,
and most owners describe their animals as appearing relieved. But each dog is
different. It’s not uncommon for a dog to empty its bowels, or for its eyes to
roll into its head. Sometimes muscles seize. But it’s all perfectly normal, and
wouldn’t suggest that Argus was feeling anything. For Argus it will be going to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“OK,” Jacob said, but he thought, I
don’t want this to happen. I’m not ready for this to happen. This cannot
happen. He’d had that feeling two other times: when holding down Sam as he got
his hand stitched back together, and the moment before he and Julia told the
kids they were separating. It was the feeling of not wanting to live in the world,
even if it was the only place to live.</p>

<p>“It would be best if we can get
Argus to lie down here on the floor. Perhaps you can get him to rest his head
on your lap. Something comforting for him.”</p>

<p>He filled the syringe while he
spoke, always keeping it out of Argus’s view. Argus went right to the floor, as
if he knew what was expected of him, if not why. It was all happening so
quickly, and Jacob couldn’t suppress the panicked feeling that he wasn’t ready.
He gave Argus the sleep-inducing belly rub he’d learned in their one and only
dog-training class, but Argus wouldn’t sleep.</p>

<p>“Argus is old,” Jacob said. There
was no reason to say it, other than to slow things down.</p>

<p>“An old man,” the vet said. “Must
be why we get along so well. Try to keep him looking at you.”</p>

<p>“One second,” Jacob said as he
stroked the length of Argus’s side, his fingers slipping over and between his
ribs. “I didn’t know it was going to happen this quickly.”</p>

<p>“Would you like another few minutes
alone?”</p>

<p>“What happens to the body?”</p>

<p>“Unless you have other plans, we
cremate it.”</p>

<p>“What kind of plans might one
have?”</p>

<p>“Burial.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“So then that’s what we’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Immediately?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“You cremate him immediately?”</p>

<p>“Twice a week. There’s a facility
about twenty minutes from here.”</p>

<p>Argus gave a small whine and Jacob
told him, “You’re good. You’re good.” And then he asked the vet, “Where are we
in that cycle?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I know what you
mean.”</p>

<p>“I know it shouldn’t matter, but I
don’t like the idea of Argus’s body sitting around for four whole days.”</p>

<p>Do people sit shmira for dogs? No
one should be left alone.</p>

<p>“Today is Thursday,” the vet said.
“So it would be this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“OK,” Jacob said. “I’m relieved to
know that.”</p>

<p>“Would you like another few
minutes? It’s no problem at all.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s OK.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see me put some pressure on
Argus’s vein, so as to be sure the needle enters properly. You can hold him.
Within a few seconds, Argus will take a deeper breath, then appear to sleep.”</p>

<p>Jacob was disturbed by the vet’s
repeated use of Argus’s name, his seeming unwillingness to refer to Argus as
him or he. It felt cruel, the constant reminder of Argus’s specific personhood,
or of Jacob’s identity as Argus’s namer.</p>

<p>“Though completely unconscious,
Argus might take a few more breaths. I’ve found that, for whatever reason, the
older the dog, the longer the unconscious breathing goes on.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting,” Jacob said,
and in an instant, as the g freed itself from the back of his hard palate, his
discomfort with the vet’s use of Argus’s name morphed into anger at himself—the
anger that was often deeply buried, and often projected, but was always there.
That’s interesting. What a stupid thing to say right then. What an unimportant,
cheapening, disgusting remark. That’s interesting. All day he’d been
experiencing fear, and sadness, and guilt about not being able to give Argus a
little longer, and pride at having given him this long, but now, at the arrival
of the moment, he was only angry.</p>

<p>“You’re ready to let him go?” the
vet asked.</p>

<p>“Sorry. Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“You’re good,” Jacob said, pulling
at the excess skin between Argus’s shoulders, just as Argus liked.</p>

<p>Jacob must have given the vet a
suggestive look, because he once again asked, “Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to give him some
sort of sedative or, I don’t know, painkiller so he doesn’t feel the shot?”</p>

<p>“Some vets do. I don’t. It can just
as often make them more anxious.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“Some people like to be left alone
for a few minutes first.”</p>

<p>Jacob gestured at the vial in the
vet’s hand and asked, “Why is that fluid so bright?”</p>

<p>“So it’s never mistaken for
something else.”</p>

<p>“That makes sense.”</p>

<p>He needed to let go, of the anger
and everything else, but he needed help to do so, but he needed to do it alone.</p>

<p>“Could I stay with the body? Until
the cremation?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we could arrange that.”</p>

<p>Jacob said, “Argus,” naming him for
the second time—once in the beginning, once at the end.</p>

<p>Argus’s eyes rose to meet Jacob’s.
There was no acceptance to be found in them. No forgiveness. There was no
knowledge that all that had happened was all that would happen. As it had to
be, and as it should be. Their relationship was defined not by what they could
share, but what they couldn’t. Between any two beings there is a unique,
uncrossable distance, an unenterable sanctuary. Sometimes it takes the shape of
aloneness. Sometimes it takes the shape of love.</p>

<p>“OK,” Jacob said to the vet, still looking into Argus’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget how it ends,” the vet said, readying the needle. “Argus dies fulfilled. His master has finally come home.”</p>

<p>“But after so much suffering.”</p>

<p>“He has peace.”</p>

<p>Jacob didn’t tell Argus, “It’s OK.”</p>

<p>He told him: “Look at me.”</p>
<p>He told himself: Life is precious, and I live in the world.</p>
<p>He told the vet: “I’m ready.”</p>
