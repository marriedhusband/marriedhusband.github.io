				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I was 25 when I flew home for my father’s last birthday. His cancer had returned and he would die three months later at the age of 57. What I remember most about that weekend was the large rectangular gift box he opened. My mother had bought him a new suitcase.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I don’t know if that suitcase qualifies my family for the Denial Hall of Fame. There are so many contenders for that honor. But I’ve carried the psychic baggage over the years. I have never forgotten that image and how we lost a chance to say goodbye. I still wonder if my father was lonely in the silence that surrounded our inability to talk about what we all knew.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Decades later my mother began a long slow decline. By then, I was a newspaper columnist, a job that I often described as “telling people what you think.” I was professionally outspoken. But little had changed since my father’s death.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yes, my mother and I talked about everything — but we didn&#8217;t talk about how she wanted to live toward the end. The closest we ever came to discussing her wishes was when she would see someone in dire straits and say, “If I’m ever like that, pull the plug.” But most of the time there is no plug to pull.<br />
						<span id="more-157512"></span></p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gradually and painfully, my mother lost what the doctors call “executive function,” as if she were a C.E.O. fumbling with Excel spreadsheets, not a 92-year-old who couldn’t turn on the television or make a phone call. Eventually, she couldn’t decide what she wanted for lunch, let alone for medical care.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In some recess of my mind, I still assumed that death came in the way we used to think of as “natural.” I thought that doctors were the ones who would tell us what needed to be done. I was strangely unprepared, blindsided by the cascading number of decisions that fell to me in her last years.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I had to say no to one procedure and yes to another, no to the bone marrow test, yes and yes again to antibiotics. How often I wished I could hear her voice in my ear telling me what she wanted. And what she didn’t want.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When my mother died from heart failure and dementia, I began to talk with others. It was extraordinary. Everyone seemed to have a piercing memory of a good death or a hard death. Some of these stories had been kept below the surface for decades, and yet were as deep and vivid as if they’d just happened.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Too many people we love had not died in the way they would choose. Too many survivors were left feeling depressed, guilty, uncertain whether they’d done the right thing.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The difference between a good death and a hard death often seemed to hinge essentially on whether someone’s wishes were expressed and respected. Whether they’d had a conversation about how they wanted to live toward the end.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So, a small group of us — each with his or her own story — started the Conversation Project, a nonprofit, out of the belief that surely we could make this easier. Our partners at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement gathered experts frustrated at the pace of change who believed that the health care system wouldn’t change until the culture changed. So we are trying to change the culture.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is now, finally, a real momentum for improving end-of-life care. The signs range from the Institute of Medicine’s report, “Dying in America,” to the success of Atul Gawande’s book “Being Mortal.”</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is also a growing public awareness of the need to break through the reluctance that has kept us tongue-tied for so long. A survey we did last year showed that 90 percent of Americans now think it’s important to have the conversation. But the same survey showed something else: Only 30 percent of us have actually had these conversations. So the gap remains huge.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We still need to transform the cultural norm from not talking about how we want to live at the end of life to talking about it. The real work to close the gap is not just for doctors and patients. It’s for mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, families and friends. We have to bring people to the kitchen table to talk with those they love to have the conversation. And to do this before there is a crisis. Not in the I.C.U.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In our survey, the primary reason people gave for not talking to their loved ones was “It’s too soon.” But it’s always too soon … until it’s too late. Half of all elderly people in hospitals cannot make decisions for themselves at the end of life. Far too many health care providers are uncomfortable and untrained in these conversations.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">From all the stories shared with us, we know that what people need most is help getting started. They need a travel guide to take the first steps down an unfamiliar and difficult road. So we created a Conversation Starter Kit, which deliberately avoids being a technical medical checklist for the dying in favor of a careful discussion guide for the living.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our starter kit asks what matters to you, not what’s the matter with you. It asks what’s most important to you in the last phase of your life? Who do you want to make decisions for you? Where do you want to be? Do you worry that you won’t get enough care? Do you worry that you’ll get overly aggressive care?</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">About two-thirds of the nearly 300,000 people who have come to our website download the starter kit, which is free. We’ve been told repeatedly that conversations that had loomed as frightening and overwhelming repeatedly turned into the most intimate and rewarding moments.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Is it important to have the health care system ready to respect and record our wishes, to have health care providers become more comfortable beginning these talks? Of course. But the hard truth is that we have to begin ourselves — by thinking about our own values, by sharing them, by bringing our own beliefs into the center of the room when decisions will be made.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In my own adulthood, the culture of birth changed. It wasn’t doctors who first tossed out the stirrups and ushered in fathers and video cameras and “birthing rooms.” It was parents who said, birth is not just a medical experience, it’s a human experience. Now we are finally saying that dying, too, is not just a medical experience, it is also a deeply human experience.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Last winter we held a national dinner party to break bread and taboos, to eat comfort food and talk about dying. I shared the table with <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/nancy_frates">Nancy Frates</a>, who is known for starting the A.L.S. ice bucket challenge to honor her son Pete. “Now I understand,” she told me. “The conversation is a gift to your family.”</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When I helped found the Conversation Project, I thought we were doing this for people who were dying. I thought of my parents. I thought of “executive function” and “baggage.” What I have learned is that the conversation is also a legacy. This is the gift, maybe the last gift, we can give one another.</p>

		<h1>The Fiction of Self-Exposure</h1>
		<h3>By Molly Fischer</h3>
		<figure class="horizontal attachment-large landscape img-expandable featured"><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fischer-on-Linda-Rosenkrantzs-Talk-1200.jpg" title="The Fiction of Self-Exposure" itemprop="url"><img itemprop="image" src="http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fischer-on-Linda-Rosenkrantzs-Talk-690.jpg" alt="Blithe self-exposure quickly grows dull." style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></a>
				<figcaption class="caption" itemprop="description">Blithe self-exposure quickly grows dull.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<a class="tny-slot" name="/2" data-total-words="0"></a><a class="tny-page" name="/1" data-total-words="0"></a>
		<p class="descender" word_count="50">If you have an appetite for other people&#8217;s business, the Internet is an all-you-can-eat buffet. Feelings, jokes, gossip, petty gripes—it’s all there, and you barely have to look for it. I have a tendency to gorge, and sometimes I feel like my metabolism cannot handle such bounty.</p>
		<p word_count="154">Mostly, though, I enjoy living in this time of abundance. It was not until recently that I thought to wonder whether gluttony was dulling my palate. Could I be losing my taste for strangers’ emotional lives? This is what I found myself considering as I worked my way through “Talk,” Linda Rosenkrantz’s 1968 novel, reissued this month by N.Y.R.B. Classics. The book consists of edited transcripts from a summer’s worth of conversations among three thirtyish friends visiting East Hampton. But for a book of modest length that is, on the surface, the perfect highbrow beach read—nineteen-sixties Manhattan art-world denizens talk about parties and sex, often while at an actual beach—“Talk” is weirdly arduous. Its three protagonists have nothing but time and nothing to do but talk about themselves. It’s a bit like “No Exit,” though in this case the characters, at least, seem to be having fun.</p>
		<p word_count="149">Rosenkrantz has said that to gather the material for the book she had her tape recorder running constantly, “even dragging the bulky monster to the beach.” The tapes gave her some fifteen hundred single-spaced pages and about twenty-five characters. The finished book, which is two hundred and forty pages, has just three speakers: Emily, an actress flirting with a drinking problem; Vincent, a gay painter flirting with his straight female friends; and Marsha, a writer, Rosenkrantz’s stand-in, the one who’s making the tapes. “Talk” is made up entirely of talk; stage directions must be inferred, but action is mostly lacking, anyway. The trio’s conversations take place on the mornings after big fights; on the beach, people-watching; in the car, pulling away from the party. The summer is sorted into episodes, such as “Emily Relates Her Psychedelic Experience to Vincent” and “Emily, Marsha, and Vincent Discuss Orgies.”</p>
		<p word_count="135">Even with such apparently juicy material, blithe self-exposure quickly grows dull. Their mutual trust comfortably established, Marsha, Emily, and Vincent unleash endless confession, allowing one another to stand in for the analysts they aren’t seeing over the summer. Nobody has to coax anything out of anyone. “I haven’t told you about the big breakthrough I had last week,” one will say, just before explaining the big breakthrough she had last week. At one point, Marsha and Vincent show their genitals to one another, in a matter-of-fact way that suggests toddlers rather than sexual adventurers. For all their world-weary posturing (“It’s been an awful lot of sacrifice and pain, darling, but I had no choice,” Emily says, of analysis), what registers most sharply is their innocence—particularly as concerns Marsha’s tape recorder.</p>
		<p word_count="75">This innocence, I think, rather than a diminished hunger for intimate revelation, explains why “Talk” did not grip me. Confession is not riveting because of its details—or not primarily so, at least. It is riveting because of the stakes involved in disclosure. The speakers in “Talk” are proudly liberated from a previous era’s strictures (while talking among themselves, at least), but they haven’t yet recognized what the new era’s might be.</p>
		<p word_count="156">Sheila Heti’s “How Should a Person Be?” (2012) also depicts an interlude of artistic self-invention among young, ambitious, unencumbered friends, and it, too, incorporates the author’s actual recorded conversations. But, four decades after Rosenkrantz, Heti’s cohort brings a different kind of savvy to the project of self-documentation. They love “The Hills”; they’ve watched celebrity sex tapes. When the Sheila character proposes to her friend Margaux, a painter, that she record their conversations, Margaux is aghast: “You there with that tape recorder is the scariest thing!” she says. “Then whatever I happen to say, someone will believe I really said it and meant it? No. No. You there with that tape recorder looks like my own death.” She relents eventually, but her wariness sets the tone for a book-long negotiation of the friends’ intimacy. The tape recorder is more than a neutral witness—it’s a source of power, and both women know it.</p>
		<p word_count="92">“She paints my picture, and I record what she is saying,” Heti says, in a half-serious summary of the working relationship they establish. “We do whatever we can to make the other one feel famous.” But fame, especially fame founded on self-exposure, is a prospect they regard with ambivalence. “Most people lead their private lives,” Heti writes; they “live their entire lives with their clothes on.” And then there are those “destined to expose every part of themselves, so the rest of us can know what it means to be a human.”</p>
		<a class="tny-slot" name="/3" data-total-words="811"></a> <a class="tny-page" name="/2" data-total-words="811"></a>
		<p word_count="121">Fame interests the characters of “Talk,” too. “She wants when she’s out here in three years to come on this beach and for everyone to know who she is,” Vincent says of Emily. “I’ve always had that need,” Emily agrees. “I have it too,” he says. “I would love to be famous,” Marsha says. They’re just chatting on the beach, but their belief in openness—to one another, to the permanent record of the tape, to the more pervasive exposure that fame might entail—is a value that passes without scrutiny. In another chapter, Emily and Marsha sit on the beach and discuss sources of pleasure. After listing things like massages and dancing, the conversation grows more abstract:</p>
		<blockquote word_count="37">
				<p>EMILY: I like myself, actually.</p>
				<p>MARSHA: Me too. We’re lucky that we do.</p>
				<p>EMILY: We’re not lucky; that’s a prime requisite.</p>
				<p>MARSHA: I love it when I’m able to talk in public places.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p word_count="8">Their uncomplicated enthusiasm is both striking and boring.</p>
		<p word_count="66">A world of WiFi-enabled public sharing encourages a second skin of public self-presentation that Rosenkrantz’s trio hasn’t yet acquired. They perform for themselves but not for any other imagined audience. “Talk” documents what has turned out to be a fleeting historical moment: when it was possible to bring a recording device to the beach and not expect that everyone else has done the same.</p>
		<p word_count="150">“We’re all pioneers going through new frontiers, new jungles,” Vincent declares. “We’re breaking psychic, social land so that people following us will be able to lead better lives.” He’s talking about an acquaintance’s unconventional marriage, but the real progress the book depicts is the trio’s blossoming self-awareness. Halfway through, Marsha remarks that recording their conversations has brought her “face to face with myself.” Later, when she walks into a conversation Vincent and Emily are having about her, they obligingly rewind so she can listen. (Marsha agrees with their assessment of her behavior.) As the summer progresses, all three begin to muse over the shape the book will take and the way it will reflect upon Marsha. The results aren’t as flattering as they expected. Unpacking, in the final chapter, Marsha tells Emily what a letdown it was to describe the summer to her analyst:</p>
		<blockquote word_count="74">
				<p>I thought I was going to go in and tell him I had had such a constructive summer of working and studying myself and this and that. Instead all I did was qvetch about what a horrible person I emerged as on the tapes and how all the three of us talk about is sex and food and yet how I felt we were the only people who communicate in the whole world, blablabla.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p word_count="87">Sex and food and self-congratulation: this could also serve as an ungenerous summary of most social media. Marsha’s weary assessment sounds like the beginning of a more modern relationship to her public self. The book ends with the ambivalence that many of us feel these days about recording everything on our phones: “I wrote the book,” Marsha tells Emily, “and everything I missed in the summer as well as everything I gained was because of it.” For the first time, she sounds like one of us.</p>

		<h1 itemprop="name">A Book Buyer’s Lament</h1>
		<h3>By Ken Kalfus</h3>

		<span data-attr="2" data-ma="6" data-bt="ALLOW_ACCESS" data-rv="false" data-sub=""></span> <a class="tny-slot" name="/2" data-total-words="0"></a><a class="tny-page" name="/1" data-total-words="0"></a>
		<p class="descender" word_count="74">Bookstores have become places of regret and shame. We once enjoyed shopping in them or simply looking in their windows, back in the days when they were ordinary retail establishments. They were like stores that sold shoes or hats, but with more appealing merchandise. Now they’ve taken on moral significance. Buying a book and choosing the place to do so involve delicate and complicated considerations. You may fail to do the right thing.</p>
		<p word_count="128">I want to buy a book—perhaps it’s a specific book, identified in a review or mentioned by a friend, or perhaps simple intellectual restlessness has put me in the mood to browse a bookstore shelf and find something new. As I descend to the streets of the city where I live, I recall that many fine unread books remain on my overstocked shelves at home. I’m aware of them every hour of the day, even when I look up from the book I’m currently reading. They remind me of promises made to read them when they were bought; some of these promises are now decades old. My shelves also hold certain already-read volumes that deserve a careful, more mature rereading. I should turn back.</p>
		<p word_count="28">I don’t turn back. The day is too fair and the streets are thronged. A vigorous walk will further heighten my appetite for quiet reading, I think.</p>
		<p word_count="72">I’m unsure of my destination. Only a few of the city’s bookstores remain in business and they each need my patronage desperately. They sell mostly identical items, for mostly the same price. A familiar calculation has to be made. The calculation is primarily ethical: where would my purchase do the most good? With literary culture under threat from several directions, every opportunity to come to its relief should be seized.</p>
		<p word_count="103">In recent times, our affluent society has enshrined as principle the notion that ethically considered purchases of goods and services will produce wide-ranging social benefits. We have a responsibility to think about where our money will go, and what it will do when it gets there, before we reach for our wallets, an obligation that I usually perform—yea to the locally grown produce, nay to garments from Third World sweatshops—and sometimes privately resent. Sometimes I prefer to make my purchases with no more than the product in mind. This is especially true when it comes to my favorite product, a book.</p>
		<p word_count="95">I feel I’ve already made a significant ethical choice by stepping away from my computer. I could have bought a new book online, which is, we all agree, the least socially valuable way to buy one. Online bookstores dwell within a moral abyss, cold, unseeing, and uncaring. Their stock lies in remote warehouses where mechanical factory implements fulfill our purchases, the workers harried to keep up with the machines. The online stores’ low overheads allow deep discounts, threatening the existence of small, local bookstores that maintain a physical presence and strengthen the urban fabric.</p>
		<p word_count="119">I have to admit ignobility, then, for the pleasure I take in browsing the online stores’ electronic catalogues, nearly as capacious as any Borgesian library. I appreciate the felicitous recommendations based on my purchasing history. I like being greeted, “Hello, Ken.” I like the perfect illusion of personality without the need to reciprocate, without the intrusive intimacy of a real-life bookstore clerk who knows my name and private tastes. When the box arrives several days later, when I’ve already forgotten that I’ve placed the order, it comes with the unexpectedness and neat, deliberate packaging of a gift. Through some expert digital manipulation, the online book-buying experience improves on the gratifications we once obtained from our traditional bookseller.</p>
		<p word_count="138">In an entirely different moral realm lies the electronic book, with which I once pursued a brief, clandestine affair, knowing that it threatened my marriage to the traditional book and what is left of the traditional bookstore. I go back to her from time to time, furtively, our lovemaking entirely mechanical. E-books subvert every romantic idea I ever had about the physical qualities of the book, like its heft, the texture of its cover, and its nearly subliminal odor. E-books depart from millennia of literary history, to which, as a reader, I dearly wish to be connected. But the truth is that reading a book on an electronic device can be a rewarding literary activity, if the book is good. Best of all, e-books take up no room in my house next to my lamentably unread physical books.</p>
		<p word_count="151">With these competing, not-encouraging thoughts in mind, I reach the downtown area, where an outpost of the nation’s single major remaining retail chain is located, situated in an ethical space above the online bookstore, but only just above it. The chain’s well-stocked outlets are each attractive in the same way, in accordance with the company’s corporate design: impersonal, without sincere literary feeling. Although they offer an immense variety of titles—a variety that the serious reader will never exhaust in a lifetime of reading—we suspect that certain stranger, more adventurous, less commercial books don’t reach their shelves. Most of the charm of the chain’s shops resides in their comfortable, wireless-equipped cafés. Sometimes I buy an espresso. Sometimes I just use the men’s room, fleeing from the store in a cloud of self-reproach. The chain has been in grave economic distress for some time.</p>
		<a class="tny-slot" name="/3" data-total-words="908"></a> <a class="tny-page" name="/2" data-total-words="908"></a>
		<p word_count="81">It would be unfortunate—a catastrophe for literature, in fact—if the chain went out of business. In many parts of the nation it offers the only significant bookstore from one county to the next. It maintains a deep inventory that keeps the publishing industry afloat. Its stores are the only places where you can find a rich selection of consumer magazines and literary journals. In its children’s departments, books are purchased that may lead to a lifetime of reading.</p>
		<p word_count="104">But, really, I shouldn’t fret about the chain bookstores, which have joined with the online retailer to drive nearly all of the city’s independent bookstores out of business. Book-lovers consider the independent bookstore the true altar at which to express our devotion to literature. We believe the independent store offers more idiosyncratic selections, employs more knowledgeable and more personable staff, and maintains a more intimate relationship with the local community. Some independent shops are said to keep their doors open without profit, only because their proprietors love literature. This makes me sorry for the books I’ve purchased from every other bookseller.</p>
		<p word_count="143">My remorse enfeebles me. I recognize that I’m no longer thinking about the essence of the reading experience or the book I want to buy, which in the depths of my moral rumination has been turned into simply another form of consumption, and not even that, but rather the <em>aspiration</em> to consume. It takes me about a week and a half to read the typical book. I don’t know how many ten-day spans I have left. Eventually the unread books on my shelves will have to be abandoned, or they will join me on the pyre. The book I’m about to purchase may be among them. We all buy books we won’t live to read. These surplus, unexperienced books represent a sizable part of the literary profit margin, such as it is. Writers, publishers, and bookstores depend on them.</p>
		<p word_count="134">I turn a corner onto a shady street of small shops, where the independent bookstore is located, halfway down the block. Anxious, distracted, with the titles of the books I left at home still in mind, I try to remember why I read. It isn’t for the bookstore, nor for the consumption of the book. I think it has something to do with the presence of the permanent book in my perishable head. Outside the store I gaze at the window display, where a dozen titles offer a dozen alternate reading futures. I remain in place, waiting for the impulse that will propel me inside, painfully aware that the survival of literature depends on it.</p>

		<h1 itemprop="headline" id="story-heading" class="story-heading">Does a True Artist Care What His Audience Thinks?</h1>
		<p class="byline-dateline">
				<time class="dateline" datetime="2015-06-23">JUNE 23, 2015</time>
		</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="238" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-1">Each week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. “The writer leads, he doesn’t follow,” Don DeLillo said. This week, Adam Kirsch and Ayana Mathis discuss the relationship between writers and readership.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="14" data-total-count="252" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>By Adam Kirsch</strong></p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="128" data-total-count="380" itemprop="articleBody"><em>There is something in the act of creation that presses forward into the public realm, whether the artist seeks publicity or not.</em></p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="541" data-total-count="921" itemprop="articleBody">It is theoretically possible that artists have lived who were totally indifferent to the prospect of having an audience. But to be truly consistent, such people would have had to consign their manuscripts or their canvases to the fire, unseen by anyone; and so they would leave no trace in history by which their existence could be known. There would be something truly sublime about such an act, because it would sacrifice even the possibility of becoming known as a sacrifice. It would be an act of ultimate integrity and self-sufficiency.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="727" data-total-count="1648" itemprop="articleBody">Whether it would be the act of an artist is another question. Literary history knows of writers who have come to the very edge of oblivion: Kafka ordered his executor to burn his manuscripts; Dickinson left her hundreds of poems in a chest of drawers. But even Kafka and Dickinson gave enough signs of literary existence to the outside world that their posthumous discovery became possible, perhaps even inevitable. Such writers played a game of hide-and-seek with posterity, which may look like modesty in comparison with many artists’ blatant self-promotion, but which can also be considered a form of seduction. Surely they would have been dismayed if their tricks had worked too well and no one had ever read them at all.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="780" data-total-count="2428" itemprop="articleBody">Nor should this be considered a symptom of egotism or frailty. For the truth is that there is something in the act of creation that presses forward into the public realm, whether the artist goes on to seek publicity or not. To write a poem or paint a picture is to translate inner experience into outward form and presence; it is to objectify sensation, and the definition of an object is that it can be passed from hand to hand, its shape fixed for everyone. To want to be an artist without creating such an object is a contradiction in terms. And once the object is created, it wants to be seen, just as a flower or a wave wants to be seen. Art is a form of communication, and communication cannot be totally autonomous, just as there can be no such thing as a private language. </p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="814" data-total-count="3242" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-2">Once indifference to audience is ruled out, however, we are left with the two choices DeLillo describes: The artist can lead or follow. This way of thinking about art is characteristic of modernity; it would have made little sense to Sophocles or Shakespeare, for whom moving an audience was the immediate criterion of success. The idea that popularity is unrelated to quality — or else actually opposed to it — can be heard for maybe the first time in Wordsworth, who insisted that “partial notice only, or neglect, perhaps long continued, or attention wholly inadequate to their merits — must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry; and that, on the other hand, numerous productions have blazed into popularity, and have passed away, leaving scarcely a trace behind them.”</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="822" data-total-count="4064" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-3">The difference between leading and following partly overlaps the distinction between fine art and commercial art, but the two are not identical. It is easy to assume that a bad best seller is written cynically, that anyone could master the formula and please a large audience. In fact, artists who are immensely popular in their day are not “following” the audience in a mercenary sense. They are, rather, people whose spirits happen to find full expression in established, conventional forms. Such artists take their reward in the present, while the others, the “leaders,” have no choice but to postpone their reward into the hypothetical future. But the kingdom of this world and the kingdom to come are both kingdoms; and it might be impossible to be an artist without dreaming, however quietly, of sovereignty.</p>

		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="766" data-total-count="5160" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-6">If I were asked a question like this at a dinner party I would raise an eyebrow in irritation, respond, “Of course, he does!” and promptly return to my dessert. In general, I find this perspective on the nature of literature to be trite, tinged with paternalism, and, I dare say, counter to the whole project of the arts. But I am getting ahead of myself. Let’s begin with the elements of the question. What, for example, is meant by “audience”? Are the audience and the reader the same thing? The reader might, for example, be the person who always reads the writer’s work in its warts-and-all early draft ­stages. Or the reader might be an abstraction in the writer’s mind, an invented interlocutor who doesn’t have a real-world equivalent at all.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="805" data-total-count="5965" itemprop="articleBody">An audience, on the other hand, is as real as real could be; made up of people in bookstores and on subways, e‑­readers in hand — oh, and the members of Goodreads, and the reviewers and critics vigorously opining. The distinction between audience and reader has everything to do with the point at which each enters into a relationship with a book. (I would add here that both entities matter to a writer, albeit in different ways.) The reader is with the writer in her privacy as a novel comes into being. The audience arrives later, when the creative process is complete, or nearly so. In this sense, despite its whiff of condescension, the notion that the writer leads isn’t inaccurate — every book is a unique landscape through which a real-world reader is guided by the writer who created it.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="595" data-total-count="6560" itemprop="articleBody">Now let us turn to the figure at the center of the second part of the prompt: the True Artist. I’m not sure such a creature exists outside the minds of those writers who would give themselves this moniker. Egomaniacs aside, I quite enjoy my fantasy of the True Artist, undisturbed by any considerations external to his work, cloistered in his ecstasy of creativity, only to emerge with a completed masterpiece that will encounter the tragi-­glamorous rejection of the masses (the work is beyond their puny understanding) or the scorn of his peers (more tiny minds unable to grasp his genius).</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="741" data-total-count="7301" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-7">It must be said, however, that the idea of the True Artist is exactly beside the point of what art and artists do. In the end, a finished work is independent of the artist (true or not) who created it, rather in the same way an adult is an autonomous being, independent of his parents. A book in the world speaks for itself; it is in conversation with the audience that encounters it. Here is Aleksandar Hemon on the subject, from a 2000 interview in Bomb magazine: He wants “to construct a story as a space of exchange and invite the reader in, rather than saying to the reader, ‘Now shut up, because I have a story to tell.’ I am saying — at least I like to think I am — ‘Come on, join in, we are telling stories here.’ ”</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="901" data-total-count="8202" itemprop="articleBody">Yes! That’s exactly it, isn’t it? The best literature is an encounter between the audience and the writer. A book with which a reader cannot interact meaningfully is a failure. An artist must be mindful of the audience; any other position is an arrogant fantasy about what her role is and what her work might do. What that work does, if the author has written something significant, is to join the grand continuum of thoughtful creations we call art, where it will be abhorred or adored, wept with, laughed with, raged against, written about and so on. William Faulkner said famously: “But what is important is ‘Hamlet’ and ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream,’ not who wrote them, but that somebody did. The artist is of no importance. Only what he creates is important.” And certainly, what he creates finds its highest purpose in an engaged relationship with the audience that receives it.</p>

		<h1>‘Why Grow Up?’ by Susan Neiman</h1>
		<p>By A. O. SCOTT</p>
		<p>
				<time class="dateline" datetime="2015-06-15">JUNE 15, 2015</time>
		</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content">A great deal of modern popular culture — including just about everything pertaining to what French savants like to call le nouvel âge d’or de la comédie américaine — runs on the disavowal of maturity. The ideal consumer is a mirror image of a familiar comic archetype: a man-child sitting in his parents’ basement with his video games and his “Star Wars” figurines; a postgraduate girl and her pals treating the world as their playground. Baby boomers pursue perpetual youth into retirement. Gen-Xers hold fast to their skateboards, their Pixies T-shirts and their Beastie Boys CDs. Nobody wants to be an adult anymore, and every so often someone writes an article blaming Hollywood, attachment parenting, global capitalism or the welfare state for this catastrophe. I’ve written one or two of those myself. It’s not a bad racket, and since I’m intimately acquainted, on a professional basis, with the cinematic oeuvre of Adam Sandler, I qualify as something of an expert.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content">In the annals of anti-infantile cultural complaint, Susan Neiman’s new book, “Why Grow Up?,” is both exemplary and unusual. An American-born philosopher who lives in Berlin, Neiman has a pundit’s fondness for the sweeping generalization and the carefully hedged argumentative claim. “I’m not suggesting that we do without the web entirely,” she writes in one of her periodic reflections on life in the digital age, “just that we refuse to let it rule.” Elsewhere she observes that “if you spend your time in cyberspace watching something besides porn and Korean rap videos, you can gain a great deal,” a ­hypothesis I for one am eager to test.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="691" data-total-count="2352" itemprop="reviewBody">But the present and its technological lures and discontents, thankfully, are not really her concern, any more than the jeremiad is her chosen form; she comes across as a patient pedagogue rather than an angry scold. She sprinkles in a few musical references — to Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones — and occasional nods to unspecified “studies.” In spite of these, “Why Grow Up?” isn’t an exercise in pop-culture polemics or pop-sociological cherry-picking. It’s a case for philosophy of an admirably old-fashioned kind. Neiman is less interested in “The Catcher in the Rye” than in “The Critique of Pure Reason,” and more apt to cite Hannah ­Arendt than Lena Dunham.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="856" data-total-count="3208" itemprop="reviewBody">Nor, in spite of its subtitle, is her book a critique of contemporary mores. The “infantile age” she has in mind goes back to the 18th century, and its most important figures are Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant. “Coming of age is an Enlightenment problem,” she writes, “and nothing shows so clearly that we are the Enlightenment’s heirs” than that we understand it as a topic for argument and analysis, as opposed to something that happens to everyone in more or less the same way. Before Kant and Rousseau, Neiman suggests, Western philosophy had little to say about the life cycle of individuals. As traditional religious and political modes of authority weakened, “the right form of human development became a philosophical problem, incorporating both psychological and political questions and giving them a normative thrust.”</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content">How are we supposed to become free, happy and decent people? Rousseau’s “Emile” supplies Neiman with some plausible answers, and also with some cautionary lessons. A wonderfully problematic book — among other things a work of Utopian political thought, a manual for child-rearing, a foundational text of Romanticism and a sentimental novel — it serves here as a repository of ideas about the moral progress from infancy to adulthood. And also, more important, as a precursor and foil for Kant’s more systematic inquiries into human development.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content">Rousseau and Kant are Neiman’s main characters, and she conveys a vivid sense of their contrasting personalities in addition to providing an accessible survey of their relevant ideas. The Geneva-born Rousseau traveled across Europe on foot, fathering and abandoning at least five children. Kant rarely left his native Königsberg and never married. Between them, they mapped out what Neiman takes to be the essential predicament of maturity, namely the endless navigation of the gulf between the world as we encounter it and the way we believe it should be.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="417" data-total-count="4741" itemprop="reviewBody">In infancy, we have no choice but to accept the world as it is. In adolescence, we rebel against the discrepancy between the “is” and the “ought.” Adulthood, for Kant and for Neiman, “requires facing squarely the fact that you will never get the world you want, while refusing to talk yourself out of wanting it.” It is a state of neither easy cynicism nor naïve idealism, but of engaged reasonableness.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="763" data-total-count="5504" itemprop="reviewBody">When she sticks close to her favorite philosophers in describing this state, Neiman provides a useful and engaging tutorial, much as she did in her earlier book “Evil in Modern Thought.” But when she ventures into the concrete domains of the “is” — offering practical advice and polemical warnings — “Why Grow Up?” turns a bit fuzzy. The introduction and the last two of the book’s four chapters wander through meadows of half-baked observation, trading rigorous Kantianism for the nostrums of tote-bag liberalism. Neiman believes in the virtues of travel, in limiting time on the Internet, in good government and progressive education. She doesn’t like mass tourism, advertising or authoritarian politics. She wants you to think for yourself.</p>
		<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="5826" itemprop="reviewBody">And who could argue? But the real virtue of this short, sometimes frustrating book lies in its insistence that thinking for oneself is a difficult and lifelong undertaking, in its genuinely subversive defense of philosophy in an age besotted by data. You don’t have to read Kant to be a grown-up, but it couldn’t hurt.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dating is hard. Dating when you are overweight is harder. Dating when you are a big dude with a serious mental illness is nearly impossible. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I&#8217;ve had a little success dating in the nearly 10 years I’ve lived with schizophrenia. But there are a lot of obstacles. Schizophrenia is a terrifying word for many people. It conjures up ideas of murderous intent, lack of control and a host of other scary things. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I live with this word, though; I am the word. But it is not a word you can just drop into a conversation and follow with “It’s not a big deal, though.”</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I seem to fall in love easily, but it’s always with women who don’t feel the same way about me. I have seen more rejection than I care to admit, putting myself on the line like that, and it’s been a chore for me not to let my emotions get the best of me. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If it’s not outright rejection, it seems to be something else that always seems to happen. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I can remember one date I went on some months back. She was a big woman with blonde hair and eyes that had that squinty “I’m up to no good” look. We met over Match.com, and I was struck by how much time she spent going to Phish shows. Her profile was scattered with a number of bands that I had loved at different points in my life. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She was a teacher, and she mentioned in her profile something along the lines that because of her love of sparkles, arts-and- crafts, and rainbows, she was a 6-year-old in a woman’s body. Before I knew it, I was asking if she wanted to go get a beer. She said yes, a little too eagerly I thought.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I got to the restaurant about 15 minutes early and ordered a beer, apprehensive knowing that eventually I would have to tell her about my illness. Soon enough she walked in, and I was struck by the fact that she seemed a little disappointed to be there. There was no smile as she sat down to join me. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I asked how she was and, after almost 45 minutes, I felt I knew just about every detail of her life. She had ordered a couch that was too big for her living room. She had a plumbing leak in her apartment. She had spent her weekend making tie-dye onesies for her infant niece. I had barely said a word. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Finally she asked me what I did for a living, and I told her I write about mental illness. What came next were the inevitable questions: How did I get into that? Did I have personal experience? </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At that point I had no choice but to disclose my diagnosis, and after a trip to the bathroom to collect herself, she came back with more questions. Was I dangerous? Had I ever killed anybody? Needless to say the date was over shortly thereafter. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sometimes the stigma of mental illness is a deal breaker. Other times I’ve noticed it’s me who can’t take the idea of being in a relationship. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another first date several months later, with a woman with black hair who worked in Americorps. went better. We had started talking on OkCupid about our favorite comedians, then met at a brewery tasting room. Things were going well, and my disclosure to her about my mental illness was followed by the inevitable trip to the bathroom. She came back, though, and told me that she had struggled with a pretty severe case of anxiety. If nothing else we had that in common. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We texted back-and-forth for several days afterward, but this time I noticed it was me who couldn’t take the idea of being in a relationship. Whether it was fear at the thought of being committed to someone else, the raw vulnerability of being that close to someone, the feeling that I was in over my head, or just the fact that the spark wasn’t there, I ended it. I’m still not entirely sure why. She was great, and I still feel guilty about it. </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Trust is a major issue for me, the crux of my daily symptoms revolves around paranoia that people are judging me and making fun of me, so trusting someone new that fast is, in the simplest terms, extremely difficult.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On top of that, one of the major obstacles of living with schizophrenia is the fact that if I feel overwhelmed, I kind of go a little wacky. The paranoia spikes, and I can retreat into a fog of depression that can last for months. Usually it happens with pressure from work, but relationships are a huge source of stress. It’s tough to even think about. To say I’m scared would be an understatement. Contending with the elephant of schizophrenia that sits in the middle of the room is never fun.</p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I’d love to get married some day, but for now I’ve resorted to the mantra, “Don’t chase people, just keep being awesome and you’ll attract the right person.” </p>
				<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I’d like to just let it happen naturally. </p>
