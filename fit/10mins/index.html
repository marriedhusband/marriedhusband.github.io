<p class="p1">Don’t let this bodyweight workout fool you: “You won’t lift a single weight, but in just 10 minutes you'll work harder and sweat more than most guys do in a half hour,” says Gaddour. </p>
<p class="p1">Every second is a lung-busting, sweat-pouring challenge. No time wasted, no room for excuses.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>HOW TO DO IT:&nbsp;</strong>Perform each exercise for up to 60 seconds (stop if you lose good form), moving from one to the next without rest.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">You can use this 10-minute circuit anytime for a quick metabolism boost, or do back-to-back circuits to create a 20, 30, or 40-minute workout. Rest 30 to 60 seconds between circuits.</p>

<h3>Uneven Plank</h3>
<div>Max Reps</div>
<div>For: 1 Minute</div>
<p><strong>SPECIAL DIRECTIONS:</strong> Switch arms after 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Assume a pushup position with your hands directly under your shoulders. Bring one forearm down to the floor, as if you were doing a plank with one arm. (So you’re “uneven.”)</p>
<p>Brace your core and squeeze your glutes tightly so that your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. Hold for the prescribed time, and then switch arm positions.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL DIRECTIONS:</strong> Switch sides after 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Lie on your left side with your legs straight. Prop your upper body on your left forearm.</p>
<p>Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your ankles to your shoulders.</p>
<p>Now pull your right ankle as close to your butt as you can, grabbing your right foot in your right hand. Hold for the prescribed time, then switch sides and repeat with your left ankle and left hand.</p>

<h3>Crab Reach</h3>

<div>For: 1 Minute</div>
<p>Assume a crab-walk position (sitting up with hands pointing behind you), with your palms and feet flat on the floor.</p>
<p>Lift your hips as high as possible so that you are a straight line from shoulders to knees. Simultaneously, reach with your right arm over your left shoulder.</p>
<p>Pause, and return to the starting position. That’s 1 rep.</p>

<h3>Alternating Lateral Pistol Squat</h3>
<div>Max Reps</div>
<div>For: 1 Minute</div>
<p>Stand with your feet about twice shoulder-width apart. Shift your weight to your right leg and push your hips back as you lower your body as far as you can into a side lunge.</p>
<p>As you lower body, keep your left leg straight, rotate at your heel, and allow your toes to point toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>Pause, and reverse the movement back to the starting position. That’s 1 rep.</p>

<h3>Standing Leg Raise</h3>
<div>Max Reps</div>
<div>For: 1 Minute</div>
<p><strong>SPECIAL DIRECTIONS:</strong> Switch legs after 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Stand tall with your hands on your hips.</p>
<p>Lift one leg off the floor in front of you as high as you can without bending your knee. Keep your torso upright the entire time.</p>
<p>Release your leg back down to the floor to meet your other leg. That’s 1 rep.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Isometric Squat Ladder</h3>
<div>Max Reps</div>
<div>For: 1 Minute</div>
<p>Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.</p>
<p>Push your hips back, bend your knees, and lower your body until your upper thighs are parallel to the floor (or as low as you can comfortably go).</p>
<p>As you lower, imagine that you’re screwing your feet into the floor by actively pressing your ankles, lower legs, and thighs outward. (Your feet won’t move, but you’ll be creating tension.) Maintain that tension, and hold the bottom position of the squat for 1 second. Then drive back up to the starting position.</p>
<p>Repeat, this time holding the squat in the bottom position for 2 seconds. On the next rep, hold the bottom for 3 seconds, then 4, and so on for the prescribed number of reps.</p>

<h3>Archer Pushup</h3>
<div>Max Reps</div>
<div>For: 1 Minute</div>
<p><strong>SPECIAL DIRECTIONS:</strong> Switch sides after 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Assume a pushup position, but extend one arm out to your side so it’s perpendicular to your body and only your fingertips touch the floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Squeeze your glutes and quadriceps, and brace your core. Maintain these contractions for the entire movement. Don’t let your hips sag.</p>
<p>Bend your working arm and lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor. Pause, and push yourself back up. Try to use your extended arm as little as needed.</p>
<p>To make it easier, move your extended arm closer and allow it to assist more.</p>

<h3>Levitating Lunge</h3>
<div>Max Reps</div>
<div>For: 1 Minute</div>
<p><strong>SPECIAL DIRECTIONS:</strong> Switch sides after 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Stand tall.&nbsp;Lift your left foot off the floor behind you by bending your left knee. This is the starting position.</p>
<p>Push your hips back and slowly lower&nbsp;your body until your right knee is bent at least 90 degrees and your rear knee taps the floor behind you. (You can put a pad on the floor for cushion.) Reach your arms out in front of you for balance. You can hinge forward at the hips as you lunge, but try to keep your torso as upright as possible the entire time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pause, and push your body back up to the starting position.</p>
<p>You can hold a pair of light dumbbells for counterbalance.</p>

<div>For: 1 Minute </div>

<p>Assume a pushup position but extend your arms out to your sides as far as you can without letting your chest touch the floor. Your body should form a T or a cross.</p>
<p>Brace your core—as if you were about to be punched in the gut—and maintain that contraction the entire time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hold this position for the prescribed amount of time.&nbsp;</p>
