<h2>Note to the reader</h2>
<p>This book has been made by five of us. Our
starting point was some of the ideas contained in the television
series Ways of Seeing. We have tried to extend and elaborate
these ideas. They have influenced not only what we say but
also how we have set about trying to say it. The form of the
book is as much to do with our purpose as the arguments
contained within it.</p>
<p>None of the essays pretends to deal with more
than certain aspects of each subject: particularly those aspects
thrown into relief by a modern historical consciousness.
Our principal aim has been to start a process of questioning.</p>

<blockquote>Seeing comes before words. The child looks and
recognizes before it can speak.</blockquote>
<p>But there is also another sense in which seeing
comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place
in the surrounding world; we explain that world with words,
but words can never undo the fact that we are surrounded by
it. The relation between what we <em>see</em> and what we <em>know</em> is
never settled. Each evening we see the sun set. We know
that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the
explanation, never quite fits the sight. The Surrealist painter
Magritte commented on this always-present gap between
words and seeing in a painting called <strong>The Key of Dreams</strong>.</p>

<p>The way we see things is affected by what we
know or what we believe. In the Middle Ages when men
believed in the physical existence of Hell the sight of fire must
have meant something different from what it means today.
Nevertheless their idea of Hell owed a lot to the sight of fire
consuming and the ashes remaining — as well as to their
experience of the pain of burns.</p>
<p>When in love, the sight of the beloved has a
completeness which no words and no embrace can match :
a completeness which only the act of making love can
temporarily accommodate.</p>
<p>Yet this seeing which comes before words, and
can never be quite covered by them, is not a question of
mechanically reacting to stimuli. (It can only be thought of in
this way if one isolates the small part of the process which
concerns the eye's retina.) We only see what we look at. To
look is an act of choice. As a result of this act, what we see is
brought within our reach — though not necessarily within
arm's reach. To touch something is to situate oneself in
relation to it. (Close your eyes, move round the room and
notice how the'faculty of touch is like a static, limited form of
sight.) We never look at just one thing; we are always looking
at the relation between things and ourselves. Our vision is
continually active, continually moving, continually holding
things in a circle around itself, constituting what is present
to us as we are.</p>
<p>Soon after we can see, we are aware that we can
also be seen. The eye of the other combines with our own eye
to make it fully credible that we are part of the visible world.</p>
<p>If we accept that we can see that hill over there,
we propose that from that hill we can be seen. The reciprocal
nature of vision is more fundamental than that of spoken
dialogue. And often dialogue is an attempt to verbalize this —
an attempt to explain how, either metaphorically or literally,
'you see things', and an attempt to discover how 'he sees
things'.</p>
<p>In the sense in which we use the word in this
book, all images are man-made.</p>
<figure><img src="assets/0002.png" width="549" height="427"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>An image is a sight which has
been recreated or reproduced. It is an appearance, or a set of
appearances, which has been detached from the place and time
in which it first made its appearance and preserved — for a few
moments or a few centuries. Every image embodies a way of
seeing. Even a photograph. For photographs are not, as is
often assumed, a mechanical record. Every time we look at a
photograph, we are aware, however slightly, of the
photographer selecting that sight from an infinity of other
possible sights.' This is true even in the most casual family
snapshot. The photographer's way of seeing is reflected in his
choice of subject. The painter's way of seeing is reconstituted
by the marks he makes on the canvas or paper. Yet, although
every image embodies a way of seeing, our perception or
appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of
seeing. (It may be, for example, that Sheila is one figure among
twenty; but for our own reasons she is the one we have eyes
for.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Images were first made to conjure up the
appearances of something that was absent. Gradually it
became evident that an image could outlast what it
represented; it then showed how something or somebody had
once looked — and thus by implication how the subject had
once been seen by other people. Later still the specific vision
of the image-maker was also recognized as part of the record.
An image became a record of how X had seen Y. This was the
result of an increasing consciousness of individuality,
accompanying an increasing awareness of history. It would be
rash to try to date this last development precisely. But
certainly in Europe such consciousness has existed since the
beginning of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>No other kind of relic or text from the past can
offer such a direct testimony about the world which
surrounded other people at other times. In this respect
images are more precise and richer than literature. To say this
is not to deny the expressive or imaginative quality of art,
treating it as mere documentary evidence; the more imaginative
the work, the more profoundly it allows us to share the
artist's experience of the visible.</p>
<p>Yet when an image is presented as a work of art
the way people look at it is affected by a whole series of learnt assumptions about art. Assumptions concerning:</p>
<p>Beauty<br>
Truth<br>
Genius<br>
Civilization<br>
Form<br>
Status<br>
Taste, etc.</p>
<p>Many of these assumptions no longer accord with
the world as it is. (The world-as-it-is is more than pure
objective fact, it includes consciousness.) Out of true with the
present, these assumptions obscure the past. They mystify
rather than clarify. The past is never there waiting to be
discovered, to be recognized for exactly what it is. History
always constitutes the relation between a present and its past.
Consequently fear of the present leads to mystification of the
past. The past 1s not for living in; it is a well of conclusions
from which we draw in order to act. Cultural mystification of
the past entails a double loss. Works of art are made
unnecessarily remote. And the past offers us fewer
conclusions to complete in action.</p>
<p>When we 'see' a landscape, we situate ourselves
in it. If we 'saw' the art of the past, we would situate
ourselves in history. When we are prevented from seeing it
we are being deprived of the history which belongs to us.
Who benef1ts from this deprivation? In the end, the art of the
past is being mystified because a privileged minority is striving to invent a history which can retrospectively justify
the role of the ruling classes, and such a justification can
no longer make sense in modern terms. And so, inevitably it
mystifies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us consider a typical example of such
mystification. A two-volume study was recently published on
Frans Hals. It is the authoritative work to date on this painter
As a book of specialized art history it is no better and no worse than the average.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last two great paintings by Frans Hals portrait
the Governors and the Governesses of an Alms House for old
paupers in the Dutch seventeenth-century city of Haarlem.
They were officially commissioned portraits. Hals, an old man
of over eighty, was destitute. Most of his life he had been in
debt. During the winter of 1664, the year he began painting
these pictures, he obtained three loads of peat on public
charity, otherwise he would have frozen to death. Those who
now sat for him were administrators of such public charity.</p>
<p>The author records these facts and then explicitly
says that it would be incorrect to read into the paintings any
criticism of the sitters. There is no evidence, he says, that
Hals painted them in a spirit of bitterness. The author
considers them, however, remarkable works of art and
explains why. Here he writes of the Regentesses:</p>
<blockquote>Each woman speaks to us of the human condition with
equal importance. Each woman stands out with equal
clarity against the <em>enormous</em> dark surface, yet they are
linked by a firm rhythmical arrangement and the subdued
diagonal pattern formed by their heads and hands.
Subtle modulations of the <em>deep</em>, glowing blacks
contribute to the <em>harmonious fusion</em> of the whole and
form an <em>unforgettable</em> contrast with the <em>powerful</em> whites
and vivid flesh tones where the detached strokes reach
<em>a peak of breadth and strength</em>. (our italics)</blockquote>
<p>The compositional unity of a painting
contributes fundamentally to the power of its image. It is
reasonable to consider a painting's composition. But here the
composition is written about as though it were in itself the
emotional charge of the painting. Terms like <strong>harmonious fusion,
unforgettable contrast</strong>, reaching <strong>a peak of breadth and strength</strong>
transfer the emotion provoked by the image from the plane
of lived experience, to that of disinterested 'art
appreciation'. All conflict disappears. One is left with the
unchanging ' human condition', and the painting considered as
a marvellously made object.</p>
<p>Very little is known about Hals or the Regents
who commissioned him. It is not possible to produce
circumstantial evidence to establish what their relations were.
But there is the evidence of the paintings themselves: the
evidence of a group of men and a group of women as seen by
another man, the painter. Study this evidence and judge for
yourself.</p>
<figure><img src="assets/005.png"><img src="assets/0006.png"><figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The art historian fears such direct judgement:</p>
<blockquote>As in so many other pictures by Hals, the penetrating
characterizations almost seduce us into believing that we
know the personality traits and even the habits of the
men and women portrayed.</blockquote>
<p>What is this 'seduction' he writes of? It is
nothing less than the paintings working upon us. They work
upon us because we accept the way Hals saw his sitters. We
do not accept this innocently. We accept it in so far as it
corresponds to our own observation of people, gestures, faces
institutions. This is possible because we still live in a society
of comparable social relations and moral values. And it is
precisely this which gives the paintings their psychological and
social urgency. It is this - not the painter's skill as a 'seducer'
— which convinces us that we <em>can</em> know the people portrayed.</p>
<p>The author continues:</p>
<blockquote>In the case of some critics the seduction has been a
total success. It has, for example, been asserted that
the Regent in the tipped slouch hat, which hardly covers
any of his long, lank hair, and whose curiously set
eyes do not focus, was shown in a drunken state.</blockquote>
<figure><img src="assets/0007.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>This, he suggests, is a libel. He argues that it was
		a fashion at that time to wear hats on the side of the head.
		He cites medical opinion to prove that the Regent's expression
		could well be the result of a facial paralysis. He insists that the
		painting would have been unacceptable to the Regents if one
		of them had been portrayed drunk. One might go on
		discussing each of these points for pages. (Men in
		seventeenth-century Holland wore their hats on the side of
		their heads in order to be thought of as adventurous and
		pleasure-loving. Heavy drinking was an approved practice.
		Etcetera.) But such a discussion would take us even farther
		away from the only confrontation which matters and which the
		author is determined to evade.</p>
<p>In this confrontation the Regents and
Regentesses stare at Hals, a destitute old painter who has lost
his reputation and lives off public charity; he examines them
through the eyes of a pauper who must nevertheless try to be
objective, i.e., must try to surmount the way he sees as a
pauper. This is the drama of these paintings. A drama of an
'unforgettable contrast'.</p>
<p>Mystification has little to do with the
vocabulary used. Mystification is the process of explaining
away what might otherwise be evident. Hals was the first
portraitist to paint the new characters and expressions
created by capitalism. He did in pictorial terms what Balzac
did two centuries later in literature. Yet the author of the
authoritative work on these paintings sums up the artist's
achievement by referring to</p>
<blockquote>Hals's unwavering commitment to his personal vision,
which enriches our consciousness of our fellow men
and heightens our awe for the ever-increasing power of
the mighty impulses that enabled him to give us a close
view of life's vital forces.</blockquote>
<p>That is mystification.</p>
<p>In order to avoid mystifying the past (which can
equally well suffer pseudo-Marxist mystification) let us now
examine the particular relation which now exists, so far as
pictorial images are concerned, between the present and the
past. If we can see the present clearly enough, we shall ask
the right questions of the past.</p>
<p>Today we see the art of the past as nobody saw
it before. We actually perceive it in a different way.</p>
<p>This difference can be illustrated in terms of what
was thought of as perspective. The convention of
perspective, which is unique to European art and which was
first established in the early Renaissance, centres
everything on the eye of the beholder. It is like a beam from a
lighthouse — only instead of light travelling outwards,
appearances travel in. The conventions called those
appearances <em>reality</em>. Perspective makes the single eye the
centre of the visible world. Everything converges on to the
eye as to the vanishing point of infinity. The visible world is
arranged for the spectator as the universe was once thought
to be arranged for God.</p>
<p>According to the convention of perspective there is no visual reciprocity. There is no need for God to situate himself in relation to others: he is himself the situation. The inherent contradiction in perspective was that it structured all images of reality to address a single spectator who, unlike God, could only be in one place at a time.</p>
<figure><img src="assets/0008.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>After the invention of the camera this contradiction gradually became apparent.</p>
<figure><img src="assets/0009.png"><figcaption>Still from Man with a Movie Camera by Vertov</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>I'm an eye. A mechanical eye. I, the machine, show you
a world the way only I can see it. I free myself for
today and forever from human immobility. I'm in
constant movement. I approach and pull away from
objects. I creep under them. I move alongside a running
horse's mouth. I fall and rise with the falling and rising
bodies. This is I, the machine, manoeuvring in the ch aotic
movements, recording one movement after another in
the most complex combinations.<br>
Freed from the boundaries of time and space, I
co- ordinate any and all points of the universe, wherever
I want them to be. My way leads towards the creation
of a fresh perception of the world. Thus I explain in a
new way the world unknown to you.*</blockquote>
