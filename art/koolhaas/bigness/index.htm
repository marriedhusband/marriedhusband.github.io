<h1>Bigness or the problem of Large</h1>
<h4>Rem Koolhaas</h4>

<p>Beyond a certain scale, architecture acquires the properties of Bigness. The best reason to broach Bigness is theone given by climbers of Mount Everest: “because it is there.”; Bigness is ultimate architecture.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that the size of a building aloneembodies an ideological program, independent of thewill of its architects. Of all possible categories, Bignessdoes not seem to deserve a manifesto; discredited as anintelleclual problem, it is apparently on its way to extinction — like the dinosaur — through clumsiness, slowness,inflexibility, difficulty. But in fact, only Bigness instigatesthe regime of complexity that mobilizes the full intelligence of architecture and its related fields.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago, a generation of conceptualbreakthroughs and supporting technologies unleashedan architectural Big Bang. By randomizing circulation,short-circuiting distance, artificializing interiors, reducing mass, stretching climensions, and accelerating construction, the elevator, electricity, air-conditioning, steel, and finally? the new infrastructures formes a cluster of&nbsp;mutations that induced another species of architecture.The combined effects of these inventions were structurestaller and deeper-Bigger-than ever before conceive, witha parallel potential for the reorganization of the socialworId – a vastly richer programmation.</p>

<h3>Teorems</h3>
<p>Fuelled initially by the thoughtless energy of the purely&nbsp;quantitative, Bigness has been, for nearly a century, acondition almost without thinkers, a revolution withoutprogram. Delirious New York implied a latent “Teory&nbsp;of Bigness”; based on five theorems.l. Beyond a certain critical mass, a building becomes aBig Building. Such a mass can no longer be controlledby a single architectural gesture, or even by any com-bination of architectural gestures. Tis impo s sibility&nbsp;triggers the autonomy of its parts, but that is not thesame as fragmentation: the parts remain committed tothe whole.2. The elevator - with its potential to establish mechani-cal rather than architectural connections-and its family&nbsp;of related inventions render null and void the classicalrepertoire of architecture. Issues of composition, scale, proportion, detail are now moot. The “art”; of architec-ture is useless in Bigness.3. In Bigness, the distance between core and envelopeincreases to the point where the facade can no longerreveal what happens inside. The humanist expectation of&nbsp;“honesty” is doomed: interior and exterior architecturesbecome separate projects, one dealing with the instability of programmatic and iconographic needs, the other- agent of clisinformation—offering the city the apparentstability of an object. Where architecture reveals, Bignessperplexes; Bigness transforms the city from a summationof cortainties into an accumulation of mysteries. Whatyou see-is no longer what you get.</p>

<p>4. Trough size alone,—such buildings enter an amoraldomain, beyond good or bad.Teir impact is independ-ent of their quality.</p>

<p>5. Together, all these breaks—with scale, with architectura composition, with tradition, with transparency, with ethics—imply the final, most radical break: Bignessis no longer part of any urban tissue. It exists; at most, itcoexists. {ts subtext is fuck context.</p>
  


      
  
<h3>Modernization</h3>
<p>In 1970s, BIGNESS seemed a phenomenon of and for (the) New World(s). But in the second half of the eighties, signs multiplied of a new wave of modernization that would engulf—in more or less camouflaged form—the Old World, provoking episodes of a new beginning even on the “finished” continent. Against the background of&nbsp;Europe, the shock of BIGNESS forced us to make what was implicit in Delirious New York explicit in our work.</p>
<p>BIGNESS became a double polemic, confronting earlier attempts at integration and concentration and contemporary doctrines that question the possibility of the Whole and the Real as viable categories and resign themselves to architecture’s supposedly inevitable disassembly and dissolution.</p>
<p>Europeans had surpassed the threat of BIGNESS by theorizing it beyond the point of application. Their contribution had been the “gift” of the megastructure, a kind of all-embracing, all-enabling technical support that ultimately questioned the status of the individual building: a very safe BIGNESS, its true implications excluding implementation. Yona Friedman’s urbanisme spatiale (1958) was emblematic: BIGNESS floats over Paris like a metallic blanket of clouds, promising unlimited but unfocused potential renewal of “everything,” but neverlands, never confronts, never claims its rightful place criticism as decoration.</p> 

<p>In 1972, Beaubourg—Platonic Loft—had proposed spaces where “anything’ was possible. The resulting flexibility was unmasked as the imposition of a theoretical average at the expense of both character and precision—entity at the price of identity. Perversely, its sheer demonstrativeness precluded the genuine neutrality realized without effort in the American skyscraper.</p>

<p>So marked was the generation of May ‘68, my generation supremely intelligent, well informed, correctly traumatized by selected cataclysms, frank in its borrowings from other disciplines — by the failure of this and similar models of density and integration—by their systematic insensitivity to the particular—that it proposed two major defense lines: dismantlement and disappearance.</p>

<p>In the first, the world is decomposed into incompatible fractals of uniqueness, each a pretext for further disintegration of the whole: a paroxysm of fragmentation that turns the particular into a system. Behind this breakdown of program according to the smallest functional particles looms the perversely unconscious revenge of&nbsp;the old form—follows-function doctrine that drives the content of the project, behind fireworks of intellectual and formal sophistication, relentlessly toward the anticlimax of diagram, doubly disappointing since its aesthetic suggests the rich orchestration of chaos. In this landscape of dismemberment and phony disorder, each activity is put in its place.</p>

<p>The programmatic hybridizations/proximities/frictions/overlaps/superpositions that are possible in BIGNESS—in fact, the entire apparatus of montage—invented at the beginning of the century to organize relationships between independent parts—are being undone by one section of the present avant-garde in compositions of&nbsp;almost laughable pedantry and rigidity, behind apparent wildness.</p>

<p>The second strategy, disappearance, transcends the question of Bigness—of massive presence—through an extended engagement with simulation, virtuality, nonexistence. A patchwork of arguments scavenged since the sixties from American sociologists, ideologues, philosophers, French intellectuals, cybermystics, etc., suggests that architecture will be the first “solid that melts into air” through the combined effects of demographic trends, electronics, media, speed, the economy, leisure, the death of God, the book, the phone, the fax, affluence, democracy, the end of the Big Story...</p>

<p>Preempting architecture’s actual disappearance, this avant-garde is experimenting with real or simulated virtuality, reclaiming, in the name of modesty, its former omnipotence in the world of virtual reality (where fascism may be pursued with impunity).</p>

<h3>Maximum</h3>
<p>Paradoxically, the Whole and the Real ceased to existas possible enterprises for the architect exactly at themomentwhere the approaching end of the second mil-lennium saw an all-out rush to reorganization, consoli-dation, expansion, a clamoring for megascale. Otherwiseengaged, an entire profession was incapable, finally, of&nbsp;exploiting dramatic social and economic events that, if&nbsp;confronted, could restore its credibility.The absence of a theory of Bigness-what is the maximumarchitecture can do- is architecture’s most debilitatingweakness. Without a theory of Bigness, architects arein the position of Frankenstein’s creators: instigators of&nbsp;a partly successful experiment whose results are running amok and are therefore discredited.Because thereis no theory of Bigness, we don’t know what to do withit, we don’t know where to put it, we don’t know whento use it, we don’t know how to plan it. Big mistakes areour only connection to Bigness.But in spite of its dumbname, Bigness is a theoretical domain at this fin de sie-cle: in a landscape of disarray, disassembly, dissociation,disclamation, the attraction of Bigness is its potential toreconstruct the Whole, resurrect the Real, reinvent thecollective, reclaim maximum possibility.Only through Bigness can architecture dissociate itself&nbsp;from the exhausted artistic/ideological movements of&nbsp;modernism and formalism to regain its instrumental-ity as vehicle of modernization. Bigness recognizes thatarchitecture as we know it is in difficulty, but it doesnot overcompensate through regurgitations of evenmore architecture. It proposes a new economy in whichno longer “ all is architecture,” but in which a strategicposition is regained through retreat and con-centration,yielding the rest of a contested territory to enemy forces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Beginning</h3>
<p>Bigness destroys, but it is also a new beginning. It canreassemble what it breaks. A paradox of Bigness is thatin spite of the calculation that goes into its planning -infact, through its very rigidities-it is the one architecturethat engineers the unpredictable. Instead of enforcingcoexistence’ Bigness depends on regimes of freedoms,the assembly of maximum difference.Only Bigness can sustain a promiscuous proliferationof events in a single container. It deveelops strategies toorganize both their independence and interdependencewithin a larger entity in a symbiosis that exacerbatesrather than compromises specificity. Trough contami-nation rather than purity and quantity rather than quali-ty, only Bigness can support genuinely new relationshipsbetween functional entities that expand rather than limittheir identities. The artificiality and complexity of Big-ness release function from its defensive armor to allowa kind of liquefaction; programmatic elements returnswith each other to create new events-Bigness returns to amodel of programmatic alchemy.At first sight, the activities amassed in tho structure of&nbsp;Bigness demand to interact, but Bigness also keeps them apart. Like plutonium rods that, more or less immersed,dampen or promote nuclear reaction, Bigness regulatesthe intensities of programmatic coexistence.Although Bigness is a blueprint for perpetual intensity,it also offers degrees of serenity and even blandness. Itis simply ; impossible to animate its entire mass withintention. Its vastness exhausts architecture’s compulsiveneed to decide and determine. Zones will be left out, freefrom architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Team</h3>
<p>Bigness is where architecture becomes both mostand least arehitectural: most because of the enormity&nbsp;of the object; least through the loss of autonomy -itbeeomes instrument of other forces, it depends. Bignessis impersonal: the architect is no -longer condemnedto stardom. Even as Bigness enters the stratosphere of&nbsp;architectural ambition-the pure chill of megalomania -itcan be aehieved only at the price of giving up control, of&nbsp;transmogrification. It implies a web of umbilical cordsto other disziplines whose performance is as criticalas’the arehitect’s: like mountain climbers tied togetherby lifesaving ropes, the makers of Bigness are a team (aword not mentioned in the last 40 years of architecturalpolemic).Beyond signature, Bigness means surrender to tech-nologies; to engineers, contractors, manufacturers; topolitics; to others. It promises architecture a kind of&nbsp;post-heroic status-a realignment with neutrality.</p>

<h3>Bastion</h3>
<p>If Bigness transforms architecture, its accumulationgenerates a new kind of city. The exterior of the city isno longer a collective theater where “it” happens; there’sno collective “it” left. The street has become residue,organizational device, mere segment of the continu-ous metropolitan plane where the remnants of the pastface the equipments of the new in an uneasy standoff.Bigness can exist any where on that plane. Not only isBigness incapable of establishing relationships with theclassical city-at most, it coexists-but in the quantity andcomplexity of the facilities it offers, it is itself urban.Bigness no longer needs the city: it competes with thecity; it represents the city; it preempts the city; or betterstill, it is the city. If urbanism generates potential andarchitecture exploits it, Bigness enlists the generosity of&nbsp;urbanism against the meanness of architecture. Bigness= urbanism vs. architecture.Bigness, through its very independence of context, isthe one architecture that can survive, even exploit, thenow-global condition of the tabula rasa: it does not takeits inspiration from givens too often squeezed for the lastdrop of meaning; it gravitates opportunistically to locations of maximum infrastructural promise; it is, finally,its own raison d’etre. In spite of its size, it is modest.Bigness is the last bastion of architecture-a contraction,a hyper- architecture. The containers of Bigness will belandmarks in a post-architectural landscape-a worldscraped of architecture in the way Richter’s paintingsare scraped of paint: inflexible, immutable, definitive,forever there, generated through superhuman effort.Bigness surrenders the field to after-architecture.Not all architecture, not all program, not all events willbe swallowed by Bigness. Tere are many “needs” toounfocused, tho weak, too unrespectable, too defiant, toosecret, too subversive, too weak, too “nothing” to be partof the constellations of Bigness.Bigness is the last bastion of architecture-a contraction,a hyper- architecture. The containers of Bigness will belandmarks in a post-architectural landscape-a worldscraped of architecture in the way Richter’s paintingsare scraped of paint: inflexible, immutable, definitive,forever there, generated through superhuman effort.Bigness surrenders the field to after-architecture.</p>
