<p>The fog surrounding the origins of photography is not quite as
thick as that enveloping the beginnings of printing. In the case
of the former it was perhaps more obvious that the hour of invention
had arrived, for it had been apprehended by a number of
people: men striving independently towards the same goal, that is,
to capture images in the <em>camera obscura</em> which had certainly been
known since Leonardo’s time, if not before. When Niepce and
Daguerre, after approximately fifty years of experiment, succeeded
in doing this simultaneously, the state used the legal difficulties
encountered by the inventors over patent rights to assume control
of the enterprise, thereby making it public by covering its
costs. In this way the conditions were established for a continuously
accelerating development which for a long period foreclosed
all retrospective appraisal. This is why the historical or, if you like,
philosophical questions relating to the rise and fall of photography
have remained unattended for decades. And if today we are becoming
conscious of them, there is a precise reason for it. Recent
studies start from the striking fact that the prime of photography&nbsp;— the work of Hill, Cameron, Hugo and Nadar — occurs in its first
decade. But that is the decade which precedes its industrialisation.
Not that this early period was not already full of market vendors
and charlatans who had mastered the new technique for the sake
of profit; indeed they did so on a mass scale. But the latter
belonged to the fairground and its traditional arts, where photography
has always been at home, rather than to industry. Industry
conquered the field with the visiting-card snapshot, its first manufacturer
characteristically becoming a millionaire. It would not be
surprising if the photographic practices which today, for the first
time, direct our gaze back to that pre-industrial prime, turned out
to be linked subterraneously with the crisis of capitalism. But that
does not allow us to pretend that the charm of the older pictures,
such as have recently appeared in handsome volumes,<sup><a href="#n01" id="backn01">1</a></sup> can provide
real insights into the nature of photography. Attempts to master
the subject theoretically have so far proved thoroughly rudimentary.
And in the previous century none of the many debates on the
matter could be free of that scurrilous schema, illustrated by the
way in which a chauvinist rag, the <em>Leipzig City Advertiser</em>, sought
to counteract the French art of the devil: ‘To try to catch transient
reflected images’, it states, ‘is not merely something that is impossible,
but, as a thorough German investigation has shown, the 
very desire to do so is blasphemy. Man is created in the image
of God and God’s image cannot be captured by any human
machine. Only the divine artist, divinely inspired, may be allowed,
in a moment of solemnity, at the higher call of his genius, to dare
to reproduce the divine-human features, but never by means of a
mechanical aid!, here, in all its ponderous vulgarity, treads forth
the philistine notion of art, dismissive of every technical consideration,
yet sensing its doom as the new technology makes its provocative
entry. Nevertheless, it is this fetishistic, fundamentally
anti-technical notion of <em>Art</em> with which theorists of photography
have tussled for almost a century without, of course, achieving the
slightest result. For they sought nothing beyond acquiring credentials
for the photographer from the judgment-seat which he had
already overturned. An entirely different atmosphere emanates from
the expose which the physicist Arago presented to the Chamber of
Deputies on July 3, 1838 in favour of Daguerre’s invention. What
is attractive about this speech is how it manages to touch on all
sides of human activity. It sketches a panorama large enough to
render unimportant the dubious credentials which photography is
prevailed upon (even here) to accept from painting and to open
up instead the real possibilities of the invention. ‘When inventors
of a new instrument’, says Arago, ‘apply it to the observation of
nature, the hopes that they place upon it are always insignificant
compared with the number of subsequent discoveries of which the
instrument was the origin’ In a single sweep this speech embraces
the field of new technologies from astrophysics to philology: the
prospect of stellar photography is adjoined by the idea of photographing
a corpus of Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p>

<p>Daguerre’s photographs were iodised silver plates exposed in the
dark room which, by being turned about in the correct lighting,
would reveal a delicate-grey picture. They were unique copies and
in 1839 averaged 25 gold francs a plate. Not uncommonly they
were kept in cases like jewellery. In the hands of many painters,
however, they became technical aids. Just as seventy years later
Utrillo painted his fascinating pictures of the Parisian suburbs not
from real life, but from postcards, so the respected English portraitist,
David Octavius Hill used a large number of portraitphotographs
for his fresco of the first general synod of the Scottish
Church in 1843. But he took these pictures himself. And it is
these humble aids designed for internal use, which have given his
name to its historical place, while as a painter he is forgotten.
Certain of his studies actually penetrate further into the new technique
than this series of portrait heads: these are anonymous
pictures of people. Painting has known heads like these for a long
time. Where a painting belonged to the family, one might from time
to time enquire after the originals of the portraits. But within two
or three generations the interest dies: the pictures, to the extent
that they survive, do so only as testimony to the art of the person
 at Radcliffe Science Library, Bodleian Library on November 4, 2010 screen.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from 
who painted them. In photography, however, one encounters a
new and strange phenomenon: in that fishwife from Newhaven,<sup><a href="#p01" id="backp01">*</a></sup>
who casts her eyes down with such casual, seductive shame, there
remains something that does not merely testify to the art of Hill
the photographer, but something that cannot be silenced, that
impudently demands the name of the person who lived at the time
and who, remaining real even now, will never yield herself up
entirely into <em>art</em>.</p>

<blockquote>And I ask: how did the beauty of this hair
and this look encircle the earlier beings:
How did this mouth kiss to which desire
unconsciously curls like smoke without a flame.</blockquote>

<p>Or look at the picture of Dauthendey, the photographer, father of
the poet, taken when he was engaged to the woman whom one
day, shortly after the birth of her sixth child, he was to find lying
with slashed wrists in the bedroom of his Moscow home. Here she
is seen standing next to him, he appears to have his arm round
her; yet her gaze reaches beyond him, absorbed into an ominous
distance.<sup><a href="#p02" id="backp02">†</a></sup> Look at such a picture long enough and you realise how
much the opposites come together yet again: the most exact
technique can give its products a magical value which a painted
picture can no longer have for us. However skilful the photographer,
however carefully he poses his model, the spectator feels an irresistible
compulsion to look for the tiny spark of chance, of the
here and now, with which reality has, as it were, seared the
character in the picture; to find that imperceptible point at which,
in the immediacy of that long-past moment, the future so persuasively
inserts itself that, looking back, we may rediscover it. It is
indeed a different nature that speaks to the camera from the one
which addresses the eye; different above all in the sense that
instead of a space worked through by a human consciousness there
appears one which is affected unconsciously. It is possible, for
example, however roughly, to describe the way somebody walks,
but it is impossible to say anything about that fraction of a second
when a person starts to <em>walk</em>. Photography with its various aids
(lenses, enlargements) can reveal this moment. Photography makes
aware for the first time the optical unconscious, just as psychoanalysis
discloses the instinctual unconscious. Structural qualities,
cellular tissues, which form the natural business of technology and
medicine are all much more closely related to the camera than
to the atmospheric landscape or the expressive portrait. At the
same time photography uncovers in this material physiognomic
aspects of pictorial words which live in the smallest things, perceptible
yet covert enough to find shelter in daydreams, but which,
once enlarged and capable of formulation, show the difference between
technology and magic to be entirely a matter of historical variables. Thus Blossfeldt,<sup><a href="#n02" id="backn02">2</a></sup>
 in his astonishing plant photography,<sup><a href="#p03" id="backp03">**</a></sup>
revealed the most ancient column forms in pewter-glass, totempoles
in ten times magnified sprigs of chestnut and acorn, gothic
tracery in teasel. Hence Hill’s models were not all that far from
the truth when they felt ‘the phenomenon of photography’ still
to be ‘a great mysterious experience’, even if this feeling was no
more than the consciousness of ‘standing in front of an instrument
which in the briefest span of time could produce a picture of the
invisible surrounding world which appeared as alive and real as
nature itself’. It was said of Hill’s camera that it maintained a
discreet reserve. But his models were no less reserved: they preserved
a certain shyness before the camera and the motto of a
later photographer of the heyday: ‘Don’t look at the camera’
could well have been derived from their behaviour. But there it was
not a question of the photographed animals, people or babies
‘looking at you’, which implicated the customer in so impure a
fashion and to which no better reply can be made than the elder
Dauthendey’s comment on the daguerrotype: ‘People were afraid
at first’, he reported, ‘to look for any length of time at the
pictures he produced. They were embarrassed by the clarity of these
figures and believed that the little, tiny faces of the people in the
pictures could see out at them, so amazing did the unaccustomed
detail and the unaccustomed truth to nature of the first daguerrotype
pictures appear to everyone’.</p>

<p>In the visual world of photography the first people reproduced
made their appearance unblemished or rather uncaptioned. Newspapers
were still luxuries which one rarely bought, but rather looked
at in cafes. As yet they made no use of photography, nor did the
overwhelming majority of people see their name in print. The
human face was surrounded by a silence inside which the gaze was
in repose. In short, all the possibilities of portraiture depended on
an absence of contact between photography and actuality. Many of
Hill’s portraits were taken in the Greyfriars cemetery of Edinburgh<sup><a href="#p04" id="backp04">††</a></sup>
and nothing is more characteristic of this period than the extent
to which his models seemed at home there. Indeed, in one of Hill’s
pictures the cemetery looks like an interior, a secluded, enclosed
space in which the tombstones, set against partition-walls, rise up
from the grass, hollowed out like chimney-pieces with inscriptions
taking the place of flames. Nevertheless, this location could never
have achieved its effect, had there not been good technical reasons
for choosing it. The earlier plates were far less sensitive to light
and this necessitated long exposures in the open. This in turn made
it desirable to place the subject in as secluded a spot as possible
where nothing could disturb concentration. ‘The synthesis of
expression brought about by the length of time that a model has
to stand still’, says Orlik of the early photography, ‘is the main 
reason why these pictures, apart from their simplicity, resemble 
well-drawn or painted portraits and have a more penetrating and
lasting effect on the spectator than more recent photography’. The
procedure itself taught the models to live inside rather than outside
the moment. During the long duration of these shots they
grew as it were into the picture and in this way presented an
extreme opposite to the figures on a snapshot. For the latter corresponds
to that transformed world where, as Kracauer aptly
remarked, it is the split second of the exposure which decides
‘whether a sportsman has become famous enough to deserve
being photographed for the illustrated papers’. Everything in the
early pictures was designed to last; not only the incomparable
groupings in which the subjects came together — whose disappearance
was certainly one of the most accurate symptoms of
what was happening in society itself in the second half of the
century — even the folds assumed by a garment in these pictures
last longer. One has only to look at Schelling’s coat<sup><a href="#p05" id="backp05">***</a></sup>; its immortality,
too, rests assured; the shape it assumes upon its wearer
is not unworthy of the creases in the latter’s face. In short, everything
testifies to Bernhard von Brentano’s supposition ‘that a
photographer of 1850 stood at the same level as his instrument’&nbsp;— for the first and for long, the last time.</p>

<p>Further, in order to appreciate the enormous effect of the
daguerrotype in the age of its discovery, one must remember that
at the time entirely new perspectives were being discovered in open
air painting by the most advanced painters. Conscious that it was
precisely here that photography should be taking over from painting,
Arago, casting a historical glance at the early attempts of
Giovanni Battista Porta, explicitly remarks that: ‘as far as the
effect that depends on the imperfect transparency of our atmosphere
is concerned (and which has been characterised by the mistaken
term <em>aerial perspective</em>), not even practised painters expect
the <em>camera obscura</em>’ (rather, the copying of the pictures produced
by it) ‘to help them in reproducing the latter with precision’. it was
when Daguerre succeeded in fixing the pictures of the camera
obscura that the painters were left behind by the technician. However,
the real victim of photography was not landscape painting,
but the miniature portrait. Things developed so quickly that by
1840 most of the innumerable miniature painters had become professional
photographers, at first merely as a sideline, then exclusively
so. They were assisted by the experience of their original
profession, but they owed their high level of photographic achievement
to their technical rather than their artistic training. This
transitional generation disappeared very gradually; indeed, a kind
of Biblical blessing seemed to rest upon these first photographers:
Nadar, Stelzner, Pierson, Bayard all lived to be ninety or a hundred.
Finally, however, the ranks of the professional photographer were 
invaded on all sides by businessmen, and when subsequently the 
practice of touching up the negative became widespread (the bad 
painter’s revenge on photography), a sharp decline in taste set in. 
This was the period of the thick photograph album. Its favoured 
location was the most chill part of the house, on pier or pedestal
tables in the drawing-room. Leatherbound, embossed with metal
mounts, it sported upon its gold-rimmed, fingerthick pages
absurdly draped or laced figures — uncle Alex and Aunt Riekchen,
Trudchen when she was little, Father in his first term at university
— and finally, to crown the shame, ourselves: as drawing-room
Tyroleans, yodelling and waving hats against a background of
painted snow peaks or as spruce sailors, leaning one leg straight, the
other bent, as is proper, against a polished door-jamb. The accessories
of such portraits, the pedestals, balustrades and diminutive
oval tables still recall the time when, due to the long exposure, the
subject required supports in order to remain still. If at the beginning
one made do with <em>headrests</em> or <em>kneesupports</em>, other accessories
soon followed, such as were to be found in famous paintings and
which therefore had to be <em>artistic</em>. At first it was the pillar or
curtain.<sup><a href="#p06" id="backp06">****</a></sup> Already in the sixties the abler men felt moved to protest
against this nonsense. So one contemporary English professional
journal wrote: ‘In painted pictures the pillar had the appearance
of possibility, but the manner in which it is used in photography
is absurd, for it usually stands on a carpet. There is no one, however,
who has to be convinced that marble or stone pillars do not
require a carpet as foundation.’ It was the time when those studios
appeared with draperies and palm-trees, tapestries and easels,
looking like a cross between an execution and a representation, between
a torture chamber and a throne room, and of which shattering
testimony is provided by an early photograph of Kafka. A boy of
about six, dressed in a tight-fitting, almost deliberately humiliating
child’s suit, overladen with lace, is seen standing in a kind of
wintergarden landscape. The background teems with palm fronds.
And as if to make these upholstered tropics still stickier and
sultrier, the subject holds in his left hand an immoderately large
hat with a broad brim of the type worn by Spaniards. He would
surely disappear into the setting, were it not for his immeasurably
sad eyes which dominate the landscape that has been predestined
for them.</p>

<p>This picture in its infinite sadness forms a pendant to the early
photography where the people did not, as yet, look out at the
world in so excluded and godforsaken a manner as this boy. They
had an aura about them, a medium which mingled with their
manner of looking and gave them a plenitude and security. Once
more the technical equivalent for this is very obvious; it consists
in an absolute continuum from brightest light to darkest shadow.
Here, too, the law whereby new achievements are forecast in an 
older technique finds confirmation; for the former portrait painting 
had produced the unique flowering of mezzotint engraving before
its decline. The mezzotint engraving depended on a technique of
reproduction which was of course only later to link up with the
new photographic technique. As on mezzotint engraving plates, so
the light in Hill’s photography struggles painfully out of darkness.
Orlik speaks of the ‘coherent direction of light’ produced by the
long exposure, which gives ‘these early photographs their greatness’.
And among contemporaries of the invention Delaroche
remarked on the ‘unprecedented and delightful’ general impression
‘which in no way disturbs the repose of the masses’. So
much for the technical conditioning of the auratic appearance. In
particular, many group photographs still retain a sense of animated
togetherness on the plate which disappears in the print (<em>Originalaufnahme</em>).
This delicate articulation was sometimes caught with
beauty and depth within the now old-fashioned oval frame. Hence
it is wrong to emphasise the <em>artistic perfection</em> or <em>taste</em> of these
incunabula of photography. These pictures were produced in premises
where from the outset each customer met in his photographer
a technician of the latest school and where the
photographer met in every customer a member of a class on the
ascendant, replete with an aura which penetrated to the very folds
of his bourgeois overcoat or bow-tie. For the mere manufacture of
a primitive camera does not in itself constitute an aura. Rather in
these early times do object and technique correspond as clearly as
they diverge in the succeeding period of decline. Soon an advanced
optics would be using instruments capable of overcoming darkness
completely and of registering objects with the clarity of a mirror.
Nevertheless, the photographers of the post-1880 period saw it as
their task to simulate with the aid of all the arts of retouching,
especially the so-called rubber print, that aura which had been
removed in just the same way from the picture by more powerful
cameras, as it had from reality by the increasing degeneration of
the imperialist bourgeoisie. Thus, especially in the Jugendstil, a
shadowy tone, broken by artificial light reflections, became fashionable;
yet, despite this twilight, a posturing stance emerged ever
more clearly betraying by its blinkerdness the impotence of that
generation in the face of technical progress.</p>

<p>And yet the decisive thing about photography is the relationship
of the photographer to his technique. Camille Recht catches it by
an attractive comparison: ‘The violinist’, he says, ‘has first to
create his note, to search for and find it with lightning speed; the
pianist strikes the keys and produces a sound. Both painter and
photographer use an instrument. The painter’s drawing and colouring
corresponds to the violinist’s forming of his notes; the photographer
like the pianist is given an apparatus in advance which is
subject to much more restricting laws than those imposed on the
violinist. A Paderewski will never earn the fame or exercise the 
near-legendary magic of a Paganini’. But, to stay with the comparison,
there is a Busoni of photography, namely Atget. Both were
virtuosi and at the same time forerunners. Unexampled devotion
to their work coupled with the greatest precision characterised
them both. Atget was an actor who, repelled by his profession, tore
off his mask and then sought to strip reality of its camouflage.
Poor and unknown, he lived in Paris, selling his photography for a
song to amateurs scarcely less eccentric than he. He died recently,
leaving behind an oeuvre of more than four thousand pictures.
Berenice Abbot of New York has collected them together and a
selection has now appeared in a very fine volume published by
Camille Recht.<sup><a href="#n03" id="backn03">3</a></sup> The contemporary journals ‘knew nothing of the
man who hawked his pictures mainly round the art studios, throwing
them away for a few pence, often for no more than the price
of one of those picture postcards of around 1900 which show
charming views of the city bathed in midnight blue, complete with
a touched-up moon. He reached the pole of perfect mastery; but
with the embittered mastery of a great craftsman who always lives
in the shadows, he neglected to plant his flag there. Hence many
others may imagine they have discovered the pole, when Atget had
been there before them’. Indeed, Atget’s Paris photos are the forerunners
of surrealist photography; vanguard of the only really
broad column which surrealism was able to set in motion. He was
the first to disinfect the stuffy atmosphere spread by the conventional
portrait photography of the period of decline. He cleansed
this atmosphere, indeed cleared it altogether. He initiated the
liberation of the object from the aura, which is the most incontestable
achievement of the recent school of photography. When
<em>Bifur</em> or <em>Variété</em>, magazines of the avant-garde, present the merest
details under such captions as ‘Westminster’, ‘Lille’, ‘Antwerp’
or ‘Breslau’ — here a section of balustrade, there a bare treetop
with branches crisscrossing over a gaslamp, or a partition-wall, or
a candelabra with a safety ring bearing the name of the town&nbsp;—
these are merely the literary pointings-up of motifs discovered by
Atget. He seeks the forgotten and the forsaken, and hence such pictures
are directed against the exotic, ostentatious, romantic sound
of city names; they suck the aura out of reality like water from a
sinking ship. What is aura? A peculiar web of space and time:
the unique manifestation of a distance, however near it may be.
To follow, while reclining on a summer’s noon, the outline of a
mountain range on the horizon or a branch, which casts its
shadow on the observer until the moment or the hour partakes of
their presence — this is to breathe in .the aura of these mountains,
of this branch. Today, people have as passionate an inclination to
<em>bring things close</em> to themselves or even more to the masses, as to
overcome uniqueness in every situation by reproducing it. Every day
the need grows more urgent to possess an object in the closest
proximity, through a picture or, better, a reproduction. And the
reproduction, as the illustrated newspaper and weekly readily prove, 
distinguishes itself unmistakably from the picture. Uniqueness and
permanence are as closely intertwined in the latter as transitoriness
and reproducibility in the former. The prizing of the object from
its shell, the destruction of its aura is the mark that the sense of
the sameness of things in the world has grown to such an extent
that by means of reproduction even the unique is made to yield
up its uniqueness. Atget always passed by ‘the grand views and
the so-called landmarks’; what gave him pause would be a huge
row of bootlasts or Parisian courtyards full of trucks drawn up in
rank and file from evening to morning; or those hundreds of
thousands of well-worn tables you see, the dirty dishes left standing;
or brothel Rue ... No 5 where the number five appears in
giant letters at four different places on the facade. The remarkable
thing about these pictures, however, is their emptiness. The Porte
d’Acceuil at the fortifications is empty, so too are the triumphal
steps, the courtyards, the cafS terraces and, as is proper, the Place
du Tertre. They are not lonely, but they lack atmosphere; the city
in these pictures is empty in the manner of a flat which has not yet
found a new occupant. They are the achievements of surrealist
photography which presages a salutary estrangement between man
and his environment, thus clearing the ground for the politicallytrained
eye before which all intimacies serve the illumination of
detail.<sup><a href="#p07" id="backp07">*****</a></sup></p>

<p>It is obvious that this new way of seeing is least at home
where indulgence was most common: in the remunerative, representative
portrait-photograph. On the other hand, photography
cannot do without people. And whoever did not know this will
have been taught by the best Russian films that even milieu and
landscape will only reveal themselves to a photographer who is able
to transform their anonymity into a physiognomy. Yet this possibility
is very much determined by the subject. It was the generation
least intent on having itself photographed for posterity, seeking
rather shyly to withdraw into everyday life when faced with such
a prospect — like the Schopenhauer of the Frankfurt picture of
1850, digging himself well back into his armchair — which for this
very reason succeeded in transmitting its everyday life on to the
plate. But this generation did not pass on its virtues. It was only
decades later that the feature film gave the Russians the opportunity
of placing before the camera people with no interest in being
photographed. At the same time the human face assumed new and
infinite meaning on the film-plate. But it was no longer a portrait.
What was it? A German photographer earned the distinction of
having answered this question. August Sander<sup><a href="#n04" id="backn04">4</a></sup> compiled a series of
faces which vies with the magnificent physiognomic gallery opened
up by Eisenstein and Pudovkin, and this from a scientific point of
view. ‘His entire opus is arranged in seven groups, corresponding 
to the existing social order and is to be published in roughly fortyfive
albums, comprising twelve photographs each’. So far there is
a selected volume with sixty reproductions which provide inexhaustible
material for study. ‘Sander starts with the peasant,<sup><a href="#p08" id="backp08">******</a></sup> the earthbound
man, and takes the reader through all the strata and
occupations, up to on the one hand the highest representatives of
civilisation and on the other down to imbeciles’. It was not as a
scholar, advised by race theorists or social researchers, that the
author undertook his enormous task, but, in the publisher’s words,
‘as the result of immediate observation’. It is indeed unprejudiced
observation, bold and at the same time delicate, very much in the
spirit of Goethe’s remark: ‘There is a delicate form of the empirical
which identifies itself so intimately with its object that it thereby
becomes theory’. Accordingly it is quite proper that an observer
like Doblin should light upon precisely the scientific aspects of this
opus and point out: ‘Just as there is a comparative anatomy which
enables one to understand the nature and history of organs, so here
the photographer has produced a comparative photography, thereby
gaining a scientific standpoint which places him beyond the photographer
of detail.’ It would be lamentable if economic circumstances
prevented the further publication of this extraordinary corpus.
However, there is an even surer way of encouraging the publisher
apart from this fundamental reason. Work like Sander’s can assume
an unsuspected actuality overnight. Shifts in power, to which we
are now accustomed, make the training and sharpening of a physiognomic
awareness into a vital necessity. Whether one is of the right
or the left, one will have to get used to being seen in terms of one’s
provenance. And in turn, one will see others in this way too.
Sander’s work is more than a picture-book, it is an atlas of
instruction.</p>

<p>‘In our age there is no work of art which is regarded with as
much attention as a photograph of oneself, one’s closest relatives
and friends, one’s sweetheart’, wrote Lichtwark as early as 1907,
thereby shifting the investigation from the sphere of aesthetic
distinctions to that of social functions. Only from this standpoint
can the investigation go forward again. It is indeed characteristic
that the debate should have hardened most of all over the question
of the aesthetics of <em>photography as an art</em>, while for example the
so much less questionable social fact of <em>art as photography</em> scarcely
received a glance. And yet the effect of the photographic reproduction
of works of art is of much greater importance for the function
of art than whether a photograph is more or less artistic in its
composition; for the latter turns into <em>the exploiting camera
(Kamerabeute).</em> Indeed, is not the homecoming amateur with his
vast number of artistic snaps more contented than the hunter,
returning laden with the game which is only of value to the trader.
And indeed the time seems not far off when there will be more 
illustrated papers than game and poultry shops. So much for the 
<em>snapshot</em>. But the accents change completely, if one turns from
photography as art to art as photography. Everyone will have
observed how much easier it is to get the measure of a picture,
especially sculpture, not to mention architecture, in a photograph
than in reality. It is indeed tempting to put this down to a
decline in appreciation for art, an abdication on the part of the
present generation. But that is gainsaid by the fact that the
development of reproductive techniques has been more or less
paralleled by a change in the appreciation of great works of art.
The latter can no longer be seen as the productions of individuals;
they have become collective formations of such enormous dimensions
that their assimilation is dependent precisely on their diminution.
The result of the mechanical methods of reproduction, ultimately,
is to have provided a technique of diminution which helps
men to a degree of control over works of art without whose aid
they could no longer be used.</p>

<p>If anything characterises the relations between art and photography
today, it is the unresolved tension introduced between them
by the photography of works of art. Many of the photographers
who determine the present-day character of this technique began
as painters. They turned their back on painting after attempts to
relate its means of expression to the life of today in a living and
straightforward way. The keener their awareness of the nature of
the times, the more problematic did their point of departure
become for them. Just as eighty years previously, so now once
again photography took over from painting. ‘The creative possibilities
of the new’, remarked Moholy-Nagy, ‘are usually discovered
slowly in those old forms, old instruments and areas of
work which owing to the appearance of the new have, in all essentials,
already had their day, but which blossom euphorically under
the stimulus of what is happening. Thus, for example, futurist
(static) painting produced the clearly-defined problematic of simultaneity
of movement, the depiction of a moment in time, which was
later to destroy it and this at a time when the film was known,
but not yet remotely understood. ... In the same way one may&nbsp;—
with caution — regard some of today’s painters, who are working
with methods that combine representation with the use of objects
(neo-classicists and verists) as precursors of a new optical form of
representation which will soon be using only mechanical and
technical methods’. And Tristan Tzara, 1922: ‘When everything
that went by the name of art was seized with paralysis, the
photographer lit his thousand-candle lamp and the sensitive paper
gradually absorbed the darkness of several objects of common use.
He had discovered the potential of a delicate, untouched flash of
light which was more important than all the constellations given
to our eyes to enjoy’. It is those photographers who have gone over
from figurative art to photography, not out of opportunistic
considerations, not by accident, not for convenience, who today constitute
the avant-garde among their colleagues, because their
development protects them, to some extent, from the greatest
danger facing contemporary photography, namely the influence of
artistic professionalism. ‘Photography as art’, says Sasha Stone,
‘is a very dangerous field’.</p>

<p>When photography takes itself out of the contexts established
by Sander, Germaine Krull or Blossfeldt and frees itself from
physiognomic, political and scientific interests, then it becomes
<em>creative</em>. The lens now focusses on the <em>ensemble</em>; the photographic
poseur appears. ‘The spirit that has mastered mechanics turns the
most exact results into parables of life’. The more all-embracing the
crisis of contemporary society, the more that the individual aspects
of the latter confront one another in rigid opposition, so the more
the creative reveals itself as the merest form of variant, with contradiction
for its father and imitation as its mother; the creative
has become a fetish whose features owe their life simply to the
changing lights of fashion. The creative in photography is the
latter’s responsiveness to fashion. <em>The world is beautiful</em> — that
precisely is its motto. Therein is unmasked a photography which is
able to relate a tin of canned food to the universe, yet cannot grasp
a single one of the human connections in which that tin exists; a
photography which even in its most dreamlike compositions is
more concerned with eventual saleability than with understanding.
Since, however, the true face of this photographic creativity is the
advertisement or the association, its legitimate counterpart is exposure
or construction. For, says Brecht, the situation, is ‘complicated
by the fact that less than at any time does a simple
<em>reproduction of reality</em> tell us anything about reality. A photograph
of the Krupp works or GEC yields almost nothing about these
institutions. Reality proper has slipped into the functional. The
reification of human relationships, the factory, let’s say, no longer
reveals these relationships. Therefore something has actually to be
<em>constructed</em>, something artificial, something set up’. It is the
achievement of the surrealists to have trained the pioneers of such
photographic construction. A further stage in this contest between
creative and constructive photography is marked by the Russian
film. One cannot underline enough the fact that the great achievements
of its directors were only possible in a country where photography
started not from stimulus and suggestion, but from experiment
and instruction. In this sense, and only in this, one can still
derive meaning from the impressive welcome accorded to photography
in 1855 by that crude painter of ideas, Antoine Wiertz.
‘For some years it has been the glory of our century to have given
birth to a machine which daily astonishes the mind and startles
the eyes. Before another century is out, this machine will be the
brush, palette, colours, skill, experience, patience, dexterity,
accuracy, tonality, varnish, model, realisation, the extract of
painting. ... One should not think that the daguerrotype will kill art. 
... When the daguerrotype, this giant-child has grown up, when
all his skill and power has unfolded, then genius will suddenly
seize him by the scruff of the neck and cry in a loud voice: Come
here! Now you belong to me. We shall work together’. How
sober, indeed pessimistic by contrast are the following words with
which Baudelaire announced the new technique to his readers two
years later in the <em>Salon of 1875</em>. Like those just quoted, they cannot
be read today without a slight change of emphasis. But, by taking
the opposite point of view, they retain their good sense as the most
trenchant defence against all the usurpations of artistic photography.
‘In these unfortunate days a new industry has appeared
which has contributed not a little to confirming shallow stupidity
in its belief ... that art is and can be nothing other than the
accurate reproduction of nature. ... A vengeful god hearkened to
the voice of this throng. Daguerre became its Messiah’. And again:
‘If photography is allowed to complement art in some of its
functions, the latter will soon be ousted and ruined by it, thanks
to the natural confederacy which will have grown up between
photography and the crowd. Therefore photography must return
to its proper duty which consists in being a servant to the sciences
and the arts’.</p>

<p>One thing, however, neither Wiertz nor Baudelaire grasped and
that is the possibilities which lie in the very authenticity of photography.
This authenticity cannot forever be circumvented by the
reportage of cliche which forms only verbal associations in the
reader. The camera becomes smaller and smaller, ever readier to
capture transitory and secret pictures which are able to shock the
associative mechanism of the observer to a standstill. At this point
the caption must step in, thereby creating a photography which
literarises the relationships of life and without which photographic
construction would remain stuck in the approximate. Not for
nothing have Atget’s photographs been compared with those of a
scene of action. But is not every corner of our cities a scene of
action? Is not each passerby an actor? Is it not the task of the
photographer — descendant of the augurs and the haruspices — to
uncover guilt and name the guilty in his pictures? ‘The illiterate
of the future’, it has been said, ‘will not be the man who cannot
read the alphabet, but the one who cannot take a photograph’.
But must we not also count as illiterate the photographer who
cannot read his own pictures? Will not the caption become the
most important component of the shot? Such are the questions
released by the historical tensions of the ninety years’ distance
which separates us from the daguerrotype. It is in the irradiation of
these sparks that the first photographs stand forth with such unapproachable
beauty from out of the darkness of our grandfathers’ days.</p>
