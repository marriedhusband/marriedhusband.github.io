		<h1>The Bauhaus Idea and Bauhaus Politics</h1>
		<h3>Éva Forgács</h3>
</section>
<section>
		<p>Art historian Éva Forgács's book is an unusual  take on the Bauhaus. She examines the school as shaped by the great  forces of history as well as the personal dynamism of its faculty and  students. The book focuses on the idea of the Bauhaus - the notion that  the artist should be involved in the technological innovations of  mechanization and mass production - rather than on its artefacts.  Founded in 1919 by the architect Walter Gropius and closed down by the  Nazis in 1933, the Bauhaus had to struggle through the years of Weimar  Germany not only with its political foes but also with the  often-diverging personal ambitions and concepts within its own ranks. It  is the inner conflicts and their solutions, the continuous modification  of the original Bauhaus idea by politics within and without, that make  the history of the school and Forgács's account of it dramatic.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>            
<p><span class="paranumber">1</span>I first became fascinated by the Bauhaus when I was discovering the writings of the late Hungarian art critic Ernó Kállal In the collections of the Deutsche Bücherel In Leipzig. Throughout my years of thinking and working on this subject I have received unfailing encouragement, help and advice from my former professor, Dr Anna Zddor, at the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, from whom I have never stopped learning.</p>
    <p><span class="paranumber">2</span>I am indebted to the staff of the Bauhaus Archiv In Berlin and of the Getty Archive In Santa Monica for their help with my research, and I owe a great deal to my family and friends - in particular to Zsuzsa Gáspár, Kati Sebes, Peter Balassa, Peter Dondth and, above all, Gyula - for patiently discussing, reading and rereading my manuscript, as well as mercilessly challenging my Ideas.</p>
    <p><span class="paranumber">3</span>I am grateful to John Bátki for his close and sensitive translation, and, last but not least, to Pauline Wickham and Liz Lowther of the CEU Press, who made the
 publication of this work a reality.</p>
