        <p class="citation">Dear Mr Gropius,<br>As your former 
colleagues we greet you on the occasion of your honourary doctorate from
 the Technische Hochschule of Hanover. This appreciation of your 
pioneering work fills us with gladness and satisfaction, all the more so
 since we are aware of the tremendous odds you always had to fight 
against. The Bauhaus, as an institution dedicated to the development of 
both modern technical competence and the freedom of artistic 
imagination, owes its existence to you. Many years of your 
self-sacrificing labours are embodied in the school's spiritual and 
material foundations. In token of the memory of those rugged but 
beautiful years imbued by your personal contributions and the spirit of 
the collective, we have unanimously decided to elect you to the board of
 the Friends of the Bauhaus. We ask that you accept this membership as a
 sign of our affection.<br>In the name of the administration and 
Masters' Council [I] of the Dessau Bauhaus: Hannes Meyer, Wasslly 
Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger, Oskar Schlemmer, Josef Albers, 
Hinnerk Scheper, Joost Schmidt, Gunta Stölzl, Werner Feist, Fritz 
Heinze.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn1" href="#ftn1">1</a></p>

 part, true. Several firms showed interest in the Bauhaus lamps; the 
Berlin firm of Schwintzer und Gräff alone purchased rights to the mass 
production and sale of 53 different light fixture models. The firm of 
Rasch in Bramsche bei Osnabrück turned Bauhaus wallpapers into the 
school's most profitable and famous product, manufactured to this day.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn2" href="#ftn2">2</a>
 There was an abundance of orders for the advertising as well as for the
 printing workshops: the new Bauhaus-style typography was in demand for 
the packaging and advertisements of cigarettes, chocolates and shoes. 
Bauhaus textiles were acquired for the collections of the Grassi Museum 
in Leipzig, the Kunstgewerbe Museum in Chemnitz and the Lübeck Kunst-und
 Kulturgeschichte Museum. There was also increased interest in the 
non-commercial activities of the Bauhaus. Besides Kandinsky, Klee and 
Feininger, the younger Bauhaus painters Fritz Winter, Fritz Kuhr, Xanti 
Schawinsky and Lou Scheper also received invitations to prominent 
exhibitions. Oskar Schlemmer's stage workshop was invited for guest 
performances at, among others, the Dresden Staatsoper, the Berlin 
Volksbühne and the Breslau Stadttheater, and the Bauhaus band enjoyed 
great popularity.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn3" href="#ftn3">3</a></p>

 As was also done at the Moscow VKhUTEMAS institute in 1926, Meyer 
amalgamated the wood and metal workshops, and, throwing in the mural 
workshop as well, named the new unit <em>Ausbauwerkstatt. </em>As its director he appointed Alfred Arndt, who was brought to the Bauhaus specifically for this purpose.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn5" href="#ftn5">5</a>
 In 1929 he invited Walter Peterhans to head the newly established 
photography department. He reintroduced physical education, this time 
devoid of Itten's ideology, also adding courses in sociology, 
mathematics, biology, city planning, political science, psychology and 
economics. The training strove for scientific precision in every 
respect; Walter Peterhans, for instance, 'for three years taught 
photographic optics and chemistry to future photo-reporters and 
advertising photographers'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn6" href="#ftn6">6</a></p>

The Bauhaus travelling exhibition went to Basel, Breslau, Dessau, Essen,
 Mannheim and Zürich, popularizing the school's ideas and products, and 
the annual revenues - which had been about 128,000 marks - nearly 
doubled.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn7" href="#ftn7">7</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">5</span>These facts would 
suggest that the Bauhaus did, in fact, fulfil its promise: within its 
walls chemistry and creative theatre work, painting and sociology, city 
planning and photography could coexist. If these various disciplines 
were to fuse in the persons and works of individual students, it would 
mean that a generation of creative people would graduate from the 
Bauhaus far better trained, more multifaceted and richer in imagination 
than those graduating from any other institute of higher education. In 
addition, the school had begun to establish contacts with the world at 
large.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">6</span>In actuality, in 
spite of the facts indicating prosperity, the intellectual profile of 
the Bauhaus had diminished. It appears that the cause of this may be 
sought in Meyer's personality.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">7</span>For Gropius the 
separation or unification of art and technology remained an eternal 
problem and, what is more, a mystery. It is well documented that his 
slogan announcing their 'new unity' did not resolve the Issue for him. 
Even after specifying design as the chief function of the Bauhaus 
Gropius desisted from reducing the school to solely this dimension: he 
insisted on the occasional performance of music, and the continued 
presence of Klee, Kandinsky and Schlemmer. He had a multi-faceted 
concept of design itself: In planning an object or a building he 
considered the aesthetic qualities to be just as functional as technical
 aspects relating to utility. In Gropius's Bauhaus if an object failed 
to meet certain aesthetic standards it would not be considered usable. 
This was not spelled out in any programme; it was simply the case. Even 
though the painters were relegated to the background, their mere 
presence provided that opposite pole so essential for the tension needed
 for creative work.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">8</span>Meyer, on the 
other hand, refused to recognize problems. His way of thinking and 
approach as a designer was characterized by a fanatical reductivism. He 
was not the least bit concerned with art. Meyer considered art, and all 
those Intellectual and creative aspects that would have been the 
contribution of single, gifted individuals to the collective work, to be
 superfluous and even confusing. 'Art is merely order,' he would 
eventually declare, and it was precisely this reduction to a single 
dimension that brought about the changes at the Bauhaus. The objective 
of design now became equated with quantitative increment: providing 
millions with various objects. Its ideology became a feeling of social 
consciousness that would motivate further quantitative leaps in 
production leading to supplying the needs of millions. This also became a
 moral basis, making it seem natural, and consistent with its inner 
logic, that activities that produce nothing usable by the broad masses 
should be considered immoral and superfluous. Above all, the Isolation 
of painting within the Bauhaus expressed this scornful attitude. Perhaps
 Meyer simply did not dare to dismiss professors of the calibre of Klee 
or Kandinsky, but he emphatically isolated them, along with their work. 
Ernú' Kdllai wrote in 1929: 'The painting of the Bauhaus (Feininger, 
Kandinsky, Klee, Schlemmer) is totally separated from the school's 
practical shop work. It had been one of the boldest illusions of the 
Weimar period that these painters would take part in such shop 
activities - unless we consider their influence on the weaving workshop 
as evidence of participation. Even this influence ceased some time ago, 
so that in a creative sense the paintings of Feininger, Kandinsky, Klee 
and Schlemmer have not the slightest effect on other aspects of the 
Bauhaus today. Likewise, we cannot find the least contact between the 
works of the autonomous school of painting (Kandinsky and Klee's 
students) and the architecture and design of the Bauhaus workshops.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn8" href="#ftn8">8</a>
 In several writings Kállai emphasized the absurdity of this situation; 
these warning signs, however, did not sway Meyer's position. 'But 
painting goes on at the Bauhaus in spite of the isolation. There is 
quite a large number of young painters at the Bauhaus, including some 
who are not enrolled in the painting department but are members of other
 workshops. We must take it as incontrovertible evidence of the need for
 the discharging and balancing of psychic tensions that painters 
persevere in their definitely unremunerative efforts, even in this 
hostile atmosphere. Painting is capable of tapping those deepest sources
 of humanity and revealing those emotive values that are indispensable 
precisely here, amid the rationalistic squeeze of the Bauhaus's 
architectural and goal-oriented discipline.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn9" href="#ftn9">9</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">9</span>Meyer was born 
in 1889 in Basel, and was raised in an orphanage after losing his 
father, also an architect, at the age of ten. In an atmosphere of cold 
terror, despair made him turn to studying, as he stated in an 
autobiographical sketch.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn10" href="#ftn10">10</a>
 Winfried Nerdinger aptly observes that planning living spaces for the 
warmth of the family environment or for the similar intimacy of a small 
community is a theme running throughout Meyer's architectural career. 
Appropriately enough, his final project was a children's home in 
Mümliswil, Switzerland.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn11" href="#ftn11">11</a>
 Meyer was always in search of community, a safe haven in the midst of 
the frailty of human relations. Perhaps he felt most secure in a 
community that was held together more by principles and solid rules than
 by the contingencies of unpredictable human emotions. Nerdinger's 
insight is reinforced by the fact that all his life Meyer was attracted 
to external regulations that held compulsive sway, and was inclined to 
place his faith in the implacability of dogmas rather than giving in to 
internal impulses and emotions. Perhaps this accounts for his preference
 of scientific methods; for him, objectivity and the elimination of 
contingencies depending on the personality meant a sense of security and
 peace.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">10</span>Meyer was 
attracted to architectural collectives and to left-wing, international 
architectural circles, such as the coterie of the periodical ABC in 
Switzerland. In 1923 he travelled to Scandinavia to study the 
cooperative movement, and in 1924 he spent six months in Belgium 
designing the Swiss pavilion at the international cooperative 
exhibition. He also organized and directed a small propaganda theatre, 
the Theater Co-op, where two life-sized marionettes and two actors 
communicated the advantages of the cooperative way of life. Meyer 
experimented with live propaganda as an exhibition genre in place of 
'sterile exhibition stands'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn12" href="#ftn12">12</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">11</span>It would appear
 that Meyer consistently interpreted every architectural and social 
problem In terms of a denial of the individuum and an affirmation of the
 collective as the modem way of life. In the 1926 treatise, 'The New 
World',<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn13" href="#ftn13">13</a> he 
celebrated the internationality of science, technology, sports and 
Esperanto, and the institutions of labour unions, cooperatives, 
corporations, cartels, trusts and the League of Nations, all of which 
demonstrate that 'the community rules over the Individual'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn14" href="#ftn14">14</a>
 But Meyer went beyond this; he wrote: 'The novel is dead; we have no 
confidence in it or the time to read it. Painting and sculpture are dead
 as images of the real world; in the age of cinema and photography both 
are a sheer waste of energy … The creative opus as an "autonomous 
entity", as "l'art pour l<em>'art" </em>is dead: our communal conscience will not tolerate any individualistic disruption of order.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn15" href="#ftn15">15</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">12</span>Meyer's most 
Important commissions were all executed for the above organizations. 
Following the Co-op Pavilion he and his associate Hans Wittwer 
collaborated on designing the Constructivist building of the 
Petersschule In Basel; in the same year their entry in the competition 
for the League of Nations Palace in Geneva shared one of the first 
prizes. In 1929 Meyer's design was utilized when the residential school 
of ADGB, the German labour union organization, was built at Bemau, near 
Berlin.</p>

 beginning Hannes Meyer felt himself In a constrained and awkward

 However, when Gropius's resignation suddenly opened up new 
possibilities for him, he accepted the appointment as director and went 
to work with renewed energy. He believed the majority of the masters to 
be on his side. 'I feel identified with the students and the majority of
 the masters, in forming a united front categorically opposed to the 
hitherto reigning fraudulent-commercial-theatrical Bauhaus image,'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn20" href="#ftn20">20</a>
 he wrote in a letter to Adolf Behne, without specifying those who 
agreed with him in such an evaluation of the school. He wrote to the 
ideologically related fellow architects Mart Stam and J.J.P. Oud, 
offering them positions at the Bauhaus. However, in his appeal to the 
latter, he already used language such as 'although I wish better 
opportunities for your talents and abilities than that available here in
 dessau [sic]'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn21" href="#ftn21">21</a> In 1929 he also invited Willi Baumeister, Karel Teige and Piet Zwaart to teach at the Bauhaus.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn22" href="#ftn22">22</a></p>

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">16</span>This fanatical 
functionalism was merely one side of Hannes Meyer's ideological 
activities. He employed this same ideology based on a restricted 
vocabulary in his campaign against Gropius's activities as architect and
 director of the Bauhaus. In this passionate struggle that permeated his
 entire tenure as director his number one aide, at the outset, was the 
Hungarian art critic Ernó Kállai. After his appointment in 1928 Meyer 
invited Kállai to an editorial position on the periodical <em>bauhaus. </em>But
 documents indicate that Kállai's role was greater than that: he wrote 
the introduction to the catalogue of the Bauhaus travelling exhibition, 
and he made use of every possible forum to popularize the Bauhaus of 
Hannes Meyer.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">17</span>Above all Meyer
 attacked Gropius's 'aestheticism'. In actuality he was attacking in his
 architectural oeuvre the quality that constituted Gropius's advantage 
over him, both as a human being and as Bauhaus director: complexity. 
Meyer demanded unconditional simplicity and linearity in both thought 
and architecture. Gropius's functionalism included both a fascination 
with the potentials of modernism, the delight in the luxurious elegance 
provided by new materials and the grand momentum of streamlined design. 
Meyer, obeying the basic principles of a disciplined functionalism to 
the letter, countered by somewhat dogmatically labelling this approach 
as 'formalism'. It was true that Gropius had a tendency to place the 
symbols of modernism above mere functional considerations, as may be 
seen in the glass wall of the main building of the Dessau Bauhaus. 
However, by doing so, he came closer to a fulfilment of the psychic 
needs associated with the building than did Meyer, whose scientific 
approach to psychological approximation led to such results as the 
rigidly immovable installation of furniture in parallel arrays (intended
 to arouse 'comradely feelings') in the dormitories of the ADGB school.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn24" href="#ftn24">24</a> Meyer, in his article, <em>building, </em>rattled
 off the staccato cadence of new materials and technologies, as if, by 
flaunting his widespread mastery of up-to-date information, he meant to 
surpass the professionalism of Gropius, who never worded statements with
 such scientific precision. At the same time, Meyer was taking aim at 
Gropius's ulterior motives and underlying attitudes, by trying to prove 
that the same forms which were, according to him, employed in an ethical
 manner only by the new architecture, were used by Gropius as 
meaningless, empty phrases. In an article Kdllai sent home to Lajos 
Kassák, he wrote: 'Current opinion has it that what with the 
horizontal-vertical arrangements of straight lines, cubes, windowed 
corners and flat roofs, we have triumphed over everything else. With 
these, modernism has been rendered its due, and everything else may 
remain as before, and the world can go on as if nothing had happened.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn25" href="#ftn25">25</a>
 Kállai shared Meyer's view, according to which Gropius was a false 
prophet who turned the holiest of causes - progressive, socially 
committed, industrially based architecture - into a superficial 
modernist joke, and was therefore the most dangerous enemy of the 
architecture that was <em>truly </em>in the service of society, for he had deceitfully co-opted its honourable vocabulary and means of expression.</p>

aesthetic fads that here and there press into the foreground of some of 
his projects play games with Industrial materials and structures. In 
Gropius's industrial conception of architecture the idea of the house as
 a mass-produced item becomes a purely mathematical factor, and In spite
 of all of its aesthetic concomitants it retains the character of an, 
albeit stylish and witty, but nonetheless cold and harsh, calculation

among the various left-wing art movements Ideological debates had raged 
about defining 'true' Constructivism, 'true' functionalism or 'true' 
social commitment. As early as 1923 Kallai directed a polemical essay at
 De Stijl, labelling its activities as <em>exclusive Constructivism, </em>and by doing so, he judged De Stijl to be separate from the main international thrust of the movement<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn29" href="#ftn29">29</a> El Lissitzky also made Ironic references to Constructivism as a fashion phenomenon.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn30" href="#ftn30">30</a>
 A most significant element of these debates was the desire to create a 
grand new international style while at the same time style itself was 
denounced as a historically invalid category. Naturally a style was 
demanded, since they endeavoured to create the emblematic forms valid 
for the new age, but the word <em>style </em>itself was for them 
associated with a historical era that they strove to dismiss. In the 
early, passionate days the members of the Bauhaus grouped together 
precisely for the creation of this grand new style, but by the end of 
the 1920s they came to reject the very notion of a 'Bauhaus style' in 
exasperation.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn31" href="#ftn31">31</a>

Europe, in spite of all of his sophisticated attempts, had failed to 
have the Bauhaus accepted at Weimar and Dessau, a Swiss architect and a 
Hungarian art critic managed to muster the courage and faith to promote 
the despised and alien teachings of international Constructivism and 
Marxism in a Germany on the eve of Hitler's accession. In addition, in a
 Dessau already permeated by the political right, voicing such views 
endangered the Bauhaus's survival.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">24</span>Of all people, 
Kallai should have known best that the faith and ideology of 
Constructivism could not be revived. The arrival of the 'twilight of 
ideologies' set in motion a process that resulted in the absorption of 
the Constructivist formal vocabulary into the public domain of everyday 
material culture.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn32" href="#ftn32">32</a>
 Such an integration was promoted by the artists themselves: the 
abstract geometrical motifs and the new typography, as emblems of a 
progressive faith forced to go underground, now circulated as a new, 
ritualistic but marketed ornamentation in everyday use. It was 
advertising especially that offered plentiful opportunities for 
recharging the depleted Constructivist formal vocabulary with a new 
actuality. 'The advertising prospectus of a department store, with its 
well designed typography, its clear, easily legible lettering and the 
light/dark spatial differentiations of the paper's surface offers a calm
 and simple object that inspires more trust and confidence than any 
individualistic, artsy endeavour,' wrote Lajos Kassák, a witness and 
participant of this process of integration, in 1926.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn33" href="#ftn33">33</a> 'The advertisement is <em>applied </em>art, the advertising artist is a <em>social creator,' </em>he
 added. Meanwhile the former Constructivist artists advertised, 
employing a Constructivist formal language, the rubber tyres, shoe soles
 and candies of manufacturers whose consumer world was the original 
target of Constructivism. And they were doing this, as witnessed by 
Kassak's words (which would have been endorsed by Hannes Meyer), in the 
belief that as innovative social creators they had transcended the 
bourgeois, historically superannuated dimensions of individualism. The 
Bauhaus attempted, unsuccessfully, to resist this state of affairs; as 
Kállai wrote in the periodical <em>bauhaus: </em>'but neither can our ultimate aim be the obedient service of industrial enterprise'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn34" href="#ftn34">34</a>
 However, when Hannes Meyer summed up his achievements at the Bauhaus, 
he still mentioned the increase in industrial orders as his greatest 
triumph.</p>

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">25</span>The crowning 
piece of Meyer's ideological work is his free-form poem written in 1929,
 'bauhaus and society', in which he expressed a new Bauhaus manifesto.

and rejection of German society, this new programme defines the meaning 
and ultimate aim of the Bauhaus's existence as eventual integration into
 society:</p>

to resist the temptation to compare this last manifesto of the Bauhaus 
with the first one. This is not only because of the identical phrasings,
 such as 'art as a profession', which is discarded by Gropius only in 
the democratic practice of crafts, since 'by the grace of heaven' anyone
 may become an artist, whereas Hannes Meyer rejects the notion because 
in his visionary world there will no longer be any art (only order) to 
be taken up professionally. It is also worthwhile to compare the

for a single great effort, a heroic, symbolic gesture elevating the 
undertaker as a participant in a project that would 'rise towaras heaven
 like the crystal symbol of a new faith'. In contrast, Meyer's call 
summons to a task more suitable for ants than for heroes; the diligent 
manufacture of a million pieces of furniture and a hundred thousand 
apartments for the people. For the accomplishment of this task, he 
prescribes the harmonious consumption of 'oxygen + carbon + sugar + 
starch + protein'. As if he was an avatar of political correctness, 
Meyer opened the doors of the Bauhaus for students without talent: 'The 
Bauhaus . . . does not Intend to be an arbiter of talent ... but aims to
 absorb the greatest possible number of young people to enable them to 
find their proper place in society.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn36" href="#ftn36">36</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">28</span>The first 
manifesto is one loud shout: Look towards the future! 'Let us desire, 
conceive, and create!' Whereas Meyer's manifesto aimlessly shuffles in 
the present, rattling off in a monotone all those duties that fall as 
the Bauhaus members' lot; they are here, after all, to perform a 
service, their tasks are 'ordained by society'. The upper dimension of 
Gropius's horizon is unlimited; Meyer on the other hand declares that 
'we are not in timbuctoo'. Naturally we are dealing here not only with 
the personal differences between Gropius and Meyer. Rather, it is a 
matter of observing the landing place of the thought-rocket launched by 
Gropius in 1919, at a time of upwardly mobile ideas. It would appear 
that Meyer's drama consisted of his misreading of the historical moment:
 in art, considering as a triumph the downgrading/absorption/fashion of 
Constructlvist forms. As for politics, he interpreted the intermezzo of 
vigorous polarization, the euphoria of the extreme left in its reaction 
to the advances of the extreme right, as an actual historical 
opportunity. The issue is not which man was ultimately justified by 
history - for it was neither - but the fact that Gropius's manifesto is 
historically plausible, for it was adequate to the given historical 
moment, whereas Meyer's manifesto lacks credibility, for at the place 
and time of its publication it was invalid as a programme. The call for a
 collective society, the militant emphasis on the values of the 
political left that was already nearly outlawed within a venomously 
hostile right-wing milieu is a sign of an incorrigible lack of 
historical sense. Such a pointed stand in a politically polarized 
situation could pass for political heroism, but was not a viable 
programme for a director responsible for the school's survival. Meyer 
had no comprehension of the complex strategies Gropius had evolved to 
keep the Bauhaus afloat, nor did he seem to be willing to master his 
predecessor's forte, the art of navigating hostile waters.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">29</span>Against this 
harsh evaluation it could be argued that, because of the polarization of
 political forces, diplomacy's sphere of action was greatly diminished. 
It could even be said that there is a limit to compromise, and that in a
 sharply right-wing environment survival at the cost of accepting 
certain political dictates is no longer a desideratum. However, Meyer 
was responsible for keeping alive an innovative, apolitical ideal, as 
well as maintaining the educational and work opportunities of the 
students. Therefore he could, by rights, be expected to soft-pedal the 
conflicts and insist on a Gropius-like apoliticality, instead of, on the
 contrary, provoking the wrath of political powers. And Mies van der 
Rohe's Bauhaus proves that there was still time.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">30</span>At the Bauhaus a mimeographed monthly made its appearance, entitled <em>Bauhaus - the Organ of Communist Students at the Bauhaus </em>and
 featuring militant articles sharply opposing the right wing and the 
fascists. These populist-Marxist pamphlets took a courageous stand, but 
their appearance within the walls of the Bauhaus was a suicidal gesture.
 A minimal amount of sober reflection should have made anyone realize 
that in a town dominated by the Junkers airplane factory such a 
political mode would not be tolerated. It was not possible to take 
seriously both this militant leftism and the practical, apolitical 
aspect of Meyer's programme outlining design work aimed at fulfilling 
society's needs. The programme calling for 'a thousand schools', 'a 
hundred thousand apartments' and 'a million pieces of furniture' for the
 people already sounded perilously close to the radical lower 
middle-class ideology of the Nazis, whose every word began with <em>Volks-. </em>Meyer
 should have realized the importance Gropius placed on avoiding 
politics, on neutral design work, and the significance of this 
neutrality in maintaining the Bauhaus as a high-level, intellectually 
independent workshop whose autonomy could not be legally infringed.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">31</span>Thus Meyer's 
activities necessarily hastened his fall. In May 1929 Chief Mayor Hesse 
was still able to muster the slight majority of votes needed to extend 
the contracts of the Bauhaus professors until 1935. But Hesse himself 
was astonished by the large number of votes for the right: 'Even my 
municipal building councillor!' as he remarked later.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn37" href="#ftn37">37</a> Soon, however, he had a visit from Dr Ludwig Grote, state supervisor of monuments and close friend of Kandinsky,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn38" href="#ftn38">38</a>
 to report that serious political problems beset the Bauhaus: there was 
communist agitation going on among the students. The Bauhaus faculty was
 extremely concerned about this, and their anxiety was aggravated by the
 fact that Hannes Meyer, ignoring the school's apolitical tradition, did
 nothing to prohibit intramural political activity. Hesse wrote in his 
memoirs: 'Personally I never doubted Meyer's loyalty; in the course of 
our numerous conversations my Impression was that he was politically 
neutral. I recalled that once he asked me if communists were allowed to 
study at the Bauhaus, and I replied that we were not in the habit of 
examining the students' political attitudes. I added that naturally they
 could not engage in politics within the school's walls. This question 
made me somewhat uneasy, but I dispelled my doubts by recalling that 
Meyer was Swiss, and therefore rather unfamiliar with the German 
political situation.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn39" href="#ftn39">39</a>
 Dr Grote, however, did not share this view, and therefore Hesse asked 
Meyer to see him, whereupon the latter admitted that there was left-wing
 political activity at the Bauhaus. He stated that he was aware of the 
dangers this posed, and would do everything in his power to eliminate 
these tendencies. Hesse writes: 'We agreed that he would emphatically 
remind the students that there was no room for politics within the 
school. Since Meyer still had my confidence I did not think it strange 
that he asked me to put this in writing, as it would be more effective 
that way.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn40" href="#ftn40">40</a> 
Soon Hesse received word that instead of improving, the situation at the
 Bauhaus was worse, and Hannes Meyer was making no efforts to curb the 
communist students. 'Dr Grote told me that Kandinsky assured him the 
Bauhaus masters were looking on in helpless despair at these 
developments which further aggravated the already impaired 
student-faculty relations, endangering the effectiveness of 
instruction.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn41" href="#ftn41">41</a>
 Hesse, who had received similar news from other sources as well, chose 
the course of speedy action: one afternoon he and Dr Grote paid an 
unannounced visit at Meyer's office. 'Dr Grote, having had enough of 
aimless verbiage, interrupted Meyer, addressing him with an emotional 
voice: "Hannes Meyer, I believe you have misled us." Hannes Meyer 
immediately understood what the charge was about, and, putting aside the
 caution that characterized all of our earlier conversations, replied 
Instantly: "But Dr Grote, you know perfectly well that I am a 
theoretical Marxist.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn42" href="#ftn42">42</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">32</span>It was obvious 
that Meyer could no longer remain at the Bauhaus. As Hesse puts it: 'The
 parties supporting the Bauhaus would not have voted a single pfennig 
for a communist-led school.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn43" href="#ftn43">43</a>
 Meyer felt that he had been treacherously stabbed in the back. 
According to his article 'My Expulsion from the Bauhaus' he did not in 
the least anticipate that his Marxist views would make it impossible for
 him to stay on at the Bauhaus. The question still remains: why, then, 
did he hide these views? The injured tone of his letter to Hesse betrays
 a naivety (or pseudo-naivety) as he lists his merits in making the 
Bauhaus so successful. He in fact took more than his share of the 
credit, at the expense of the Gropius-directed Bauhaus; and these claims
 were later answered, possibly by Gropius himself.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn44" href="#ftn44">44</a>
 It is evidence of Meyer's peculiar style of argumentation that he 
claims credit for using the improved financial situation of the Bauhaus 
to enable 'proletarians to attend the Bauhaus', for 'after all the time 
had come for the Bauhaus to be proletarianized'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn45" href="#ftn45">45</a>
 At the end of his letter, he complains to Hesse: 'Down with Marxismt 
And for this purpose who should you have chosen but Mies van der Rohe, 
who designed the memorial for Karl Liebknecht and Red Rosie [sic]I'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn46" href="#ftn46">46</a>
 This last emotional outburst reveals how poorly Meyer understood the 
German political picture. He was unaware that Mies van der Rohe could 
afford to design the Liebknecht-Luxemburg memorial, just as Gropius had 
got away with his <em>Märzgefallene </em>memorial in Weimar, for his social and professional rank and qualifications were decided by other criteria.</p>

 Gropius himself, repeatedly provoked by Meyer's comments about him both
 during and after Meyer's tenure as director, personally considered him a
 definite disappointment, although he would always add that there was 
nothing exceptionable about his work as an architect. In 1964 Tomas 
Maldonado and Gropius engaged in a debate about Meyer's evaluation. 
According to Maldonado, at the end of the 1920s it was impossible to 
consider the social aspects of art without a concrete political 
commitment, and a politically neutral position, as Mies van der Rohe's 
tenure demonstrated, was only possible at the cost of abandoning the 
Bauhaus's progressive tenets. Maldonado credits Meyer with refusing to 
choose this route, for 'subsequently it was shown how narrow the path 
was amid the political and ideological pressures ruling Germany in those
 days.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn49" href="#ftn49">49</a> As 
opposed to this view, Gropius voiced his belief that party politics were
 a private affair that need not be involved in the social aspects of 
creative work, especially in the Germany of the late 1920s.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn50" href="#ftn50">50</a>
 Maldonado asked Gropius if it was true that originally he had had a 
high opinion of Meyer, then came to view him more critically, yet still 
recommended him as his successor, only later changing his opinion 
radically. Gropius replied that he had acted in perfectly good faith, 
for whenever they talked about keeping the Bauhaus free of politics 
Meyer was as ardently for this as himself.</p>

His political materialist views, which he had kept hidden from us, 
undermined the Bauhaus idea, set the institute on a course between 
Scylla and Charybdls, and ended by ruining himself. I don't in the least
 agree with your view that he could not have done otherwise given the 
circumstances. Not at all!... Meyer imperilled the Bauhaus not so much 
because of his political idealism but as a result of a lack of political
 instinct, making him incapable of the balancing act between practical 
work and political theory ... His strategy and tactics were too 
pedestrian: he was essentially a radicalized petty bourgeois. The 
culmination of his philosophy was the observation that 'life equals 
oxygen plus sugar plus starch plus protein', to which Mies promply

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">35</span>One of the 
nagging questions concerning Hannes Meyer remains to this day: did he 
consciously mislead Gropius? According to Nerdinger, Meyer became an 
actual Marxist, and eventually a Stalinist, only after his Bauhaus 
years.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn52" href="#ftn52">52</a> On the
 other hand Philip Tolziner's memoir mentions that, although guest 
lecturers at the institute were always announced in the periodical <em>bauhaus. </em>this
 was not done for the visit of Professor Ludwig from Moscow, whose talk 
was not given at the school auditorium but in Meyer's private apartment,
 suggesting a certain amount of political conspiracy.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn53" href="#ftn53">53</a>
 Magdalena Droste correctly points out that even though Meyer espoused 
Marxism, he did not use the Marxist terminology of his day: he spoke of 
the <em>people </em>instead of the <em>proletariat, </em>and made no mention of <em>class </em>or the <em>bourgeoisie.</em><a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn54" href="#ftn54">54</a>
 At the same time he tolerated, in a supportive way, the communist 
organization within the Bauhaus, even though this was unquestionably 
party-politics: the number of students in this communist cell rose from 7
 in 1927 to 36 in 1930.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn55" href="#ftn55">55</a>
 Still, Meyer's leftism smacked of a defiant naivety: it seems as if 
this gradual slide towards the left had been his response to the 
resistance he had to face within the Bauhaus on the part of Kandinsky 
and the artists, as well as to the local and nationwide shift to the 
right. His open letter to Mayor Hesse hints at the dual nature of the 
pressures on him, even though he does not mention the Bauhaus artists: 
'you and I both worried about the ominous politicization of the Bauhaus.
 But while to you it seemed the danger originated at the Bauhaus, I 
perceived the threat as coming from the outside.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn56" href="#ftn56">56</a>
 Meyer's naivety is also indicated in a letter written by Margret Mengel
 about Meyer's dismissal, to her friend, Meyer's companion Lotte Beese, 
who was working in Prague at the time: 'they accuse him of engaging in 
party politics, communist of course; they bring up his marxist 
education, his stand vis-à-vis art, that is, his intention to rid the 
bauhaus of art, as a final argument, they brought up his financial 
contribution to the children of the striking miners of mansfeld, the 
communist students circulated a subscription list, whereupon hannes 
generously signed up his contribution, as he saw fit it all seems like 
such an absurdity.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn57" href="#ftn57">57</a></p>

conclude that Meyer was definitely a communist from the fact that after

of 1930 Meyer travelled to Moscow, accompanied by Béla Scheffler, a 
Hungarian who knew Russian, and on 22 October he was already giving a 
lecture about the reactionary developments at German universities to an 
audience of 800 at the Hall of Unions.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn61" href="#ftn61">61</a>
 Meyer received an appointment at the State Architectural University 
(VASI), where on 3 November he lectured to an audience of 500 university
 students and faculty about the work of the Bauhaus. At this university 
he organized an exhibition he called 'The Dismantled Bauhaus'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn62" href="#ftn62">62</a>
 At the outset Meyer was perfectly satisfied; 'i don't understand why i 
haven't been living here since 1917', he wrote for the 8as/er <em>Vorwärts </em>at the end of November.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn63" href="#ftn63">63</a>
 By this time Meyer found himself at GLAVPROMKADR, the centre of 
technical-industrial planning, making his students' travel possible. 
This was no simple matter; in addition to Meyer's outstanding work, the 
well-known journalist, Mikhail Kozlov, also offered significant help.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn64" href="#ftn64">64</a>
 By February 1931 seven former Bauhaus members (Bela Scheffler, Anton 
Urban, Rene Mensch, Klaus Meumann, Konrad Puschel, Philip Tolziner and 
Tibor Weiner) had joined Meyer in Moscow, calling themselves the Red 
Bauhaus Brigade, or Red Front for short. Around this time the Soviet

Brigade was employed by GIPROVTUS (State Institute for Planning 
Technical Universities).</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">38</span>In the summer 
of 1931 Meyer organized an exhibition consisting of about 140 drawings, 
graphics, photos, and about 40 original objects (chiefly textile pattern
 samples) at the Moscow gallery of the Federal Institute of Cultural 
Relations (VOKS). In September of the same year the exhibition travelled
 to Kharkov In the Ukraine. The title of the exhibition was 'Bauhaus 
Dessau - Hannes Meyer's Directorship (1928-1930)' and it was received 
with reservations both by the viewing public and the qualified 
expert/official sector. The former objected because they did not receive
 the images of the Bauhaus they had expected;<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn65" href="#ftn65">65</a>
 the latter because they read the struggles of the Bauhaus as further 
evidence that 'within the framework of bourgeois art' it was impossible 
to break out of capitalist domination.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn66" href="#ftn66">66</a>
 'Walter Gropius's school aestheticizes technology, Hannes Meyer's 
discovers technology and turns against all aestheticization,' wrote

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">40</span>In conclusion 
it is necessary to risk an interpretation of the Bauhaus's fatal changes
 of leadership that may seem unusual. As we have seen, Gropius's 
departure had been hastened by the artists who, besides not being very 
enthusiastic about design, did not share Gropius's commitment. These 
artists had increasingly made it clear that the collective, that is the 
Bauhaus as a collective cause, was far from being important enough for 
them to relegate their own creative work even temporarily into the 
background. Gropius's disappointment on recognizing this may have been 
the chief subjective cause of his departure. We must note that Kandinsky
 and the Bauhaus artists played a significant role in Meyer's ouster, 
and not only because, as we have seen, it was Kandinsky who called Dr 
Ludwig Grote's attention to the situation at the Bauhaus. Hesse himself 
offers a more nuanced picture of this in a letter: 'There was a crisis 
of confidence at the Bauhaus between the director and the masters 
involved, giving rise to concern that the latter would not return to 
their positions at the end of the summer vacation if Meyer remained the 
director. Therefore the magistracy had to consider the possibility of 
losing some of the most valued members of the Masters' Council if the 
present director was retained.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn68" href="#ftn68">68</a>
 Magdalena Droste also believes that 'Meyer's opposition within the 
Bauhaus, led by Kandinsky and Albers, played a significant role in his 
dismissal.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn69" href="#ftn69">69</a> 
It is not certain, however, that they were dismayed only by Meyer's 
impending structural reforms or the possible curtailing of their spheres
 of activity - after all, they never wanted a greater role in communal 
affairs at the sacrifice of their time for artwork. The threat of 
communist activities must have upset them - especially Kandinsky. But 
the most likely primary obstacle had to be their metacom-municational 
difficulties with Meyer, whose strange manner and inability to engage in
 dialogue made him unpredictable. Thus the inner, artistic core of the 
Bauhaus had a greater role in shaping the school's fate than has 
hitherto been believed.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn70" href="#ftn70">70</a>
 Kandinsky, Klee, Schlemmer and Albers managed to force decisions by 
means of resistance that was at times passive, at other times active, 
without wishing to indulge in explicit intramural politicking. 
Ultimately they were more successful in having their way than the 
directors themselves. Schlemmer left the Bauhaus in 1929, Klee in 1931, 
and Kandinsky stayed until the very end in 1933, and thus almost all of 
them spent more time at the Bauhaus than Gropius and Meyer's tenures 
combined. And so we must realize that autonomous art, whose presence 
Gropius secured partially from strategic considerations and partially as
 a certain intellectual courtesy, proved to be a more solid and, 
vis-à-vis the Bauhaus, a more significant factor than one would guess 
from the school's design- and object-oriented profile. Gropius had 
intended the presence of the artists to serve as an unassailable facade 
behind which design could go on undisturbed. In effect it would appear 
that the situation became reversed, and design offered the facade behind
 which art could survive undiminished.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">41</span>To all this we 
may append one final question: Was it really possible that Gropius 
misread Meyer, of all people? Hadn't he recognized van Doesburg at first
 glance for the demagogue he was, even though Doesburg voiced theories 
very similar to his own? How was it possible that everyone else thought 
Meyer's appointment as director a mistake, and only Gropius considered 
it appropriate? At the very beginning of their acquaintance Schlemmer 
ironically tagged Meyer 'this honest fellow' and the student Fritz Kuhr 
probably summed up the opinion of the student body when he labelled 
Meyer's appointment a catastrophe. As for Gropius's closest associates, 
such as Moholy-Nagy and Bayer, they did not wish to stay on at the 
Bauhaus.</p>

 to believe that Gropius learned certain facts about Meyer only much

  Droste quotes a telegram from the Kandinsky Bequest at the Centre

  Meyer, in 'Mein Hinauswurf', op. cit., mentions that Gropius had first
 asked Mies van der Rohe, and only after Mies turned him down, did he 
approach Meyer.<br>Schawinsky (Gropius?) in the above-mentioned article.
 'Kopf oder Adler? ' states that this is not true, Mies had not been 
sounded. Howard Dearstyne <em>[Inside the Bauhaus. </em>Rizzoli, New 
York, 1986, p. 220) also states that Gropius first asked Mies van der 
Rohe to be his successor. Neither Meyer nor Dearstyne cite any 
documentation.</p>
