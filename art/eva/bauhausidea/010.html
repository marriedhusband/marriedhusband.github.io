      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">1</span>FROM the outset 
the internal structure of the Bauhaus was hierarchic, the tip of the 
pyramid occupied by the person of the director, Gropius. He had the 
right to decide about any and all organizational, personal or 
educational matters, unless it was an issue to be deferred to parliament
 or outside authorities. His immediate right-hand associate was the 
legal counsellor, who also handled financial and administrative matters.
 The director presided over the Masters' Council consisting of the 
artist-instructors. According to Friedhelm Kröll,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn1" href="#ftn1">1</a>
 their order of precedence was determined by their artistic rank and 
reputation prior to their involvement with the Bauhaus. Kröll's opinion 
is confirmed both by subsequent events and also by Gropius's letter to 
Ernst Hardt, quoted earlier, in which he emphasized the necessity of 
attracting to Weimar well-known and important artists, 'even if, deep 
down, we cannot fully comprehend their innermost meaning at this time.' 
This strategy, aiming at the enrichment of the school's intellectual 
climate and prestige, forced Gropius into a series of moves 
diametrically opposed to the letter and spirit of the Manifesto. For if 
it was true that among the hallmarks of the Bauhaus the names of 
Kandinsky and Klee carried the greatest weight and brilliance, had 
Gropius adhered to his own programme announced in the June 1919 address 
which stressed the importance of craftsmanship, neither of the two would
 have been invited to the Bauhaus. The crafts masters were not included 
in the Masters' Council; they had no votes, and were consulted only as 
occasional advisers, much like the student representatives. Even though 
crafts training occupied the central position in the original Bauhaus 
concept and in the school's curriculum, implying that art was relegated 
to a highly respected sphere that was outside and above the school's 
concerns, all the same, Groplus was adamant In his response to the 
crafts masters' demand for an equal voting presence on the council: 'It 
is essential for the work of the Bauhaus that the artists have a greater
 voice in issues involving the crafts, which can be learned, rather than
 the other way around, for art is not a matter of profession but of 
vocation ... The composition of the Masters' Council corresponds to the 
historical evolution of the Bauhaus, which owes its concept and 
Inception not to craftsmen but to artists. . . And this is a spiritual, 
not a technical, concept. . . Only those have the right to determine the
 aims and direction of our work who had a share in defining and 
formulating this concept.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn2" href="#ftn2">2</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">2</span>Naturally, the 
medieval guild-ideal, the neo-Gothic dream of a community of equals, 
artists and artisans working harmoniously side by side, steeped in the 
same faith, was not going to be realized. But not for a lack of 
electrical charge in the air, which was there in abundance to provide a 
spark for the creation of such a community of artists. However, there 
was no true democratic model in existence to prevent this, at first 
barely perceptible, tendency at the Bauhaus from growing into a tragic 
flaw: the school was compelled to try to establish a power-base of some 
sort, in order to survive among so many foes who certainly did not 
believe in mutual tolerance.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">3</span>From the first 
moment the Bauhaus was forced Into an ever exacerbating schizophrenia: 
while Gropius was actually thinking of 'mass-produced buildings' and 
high technology, in public he had to speak about crafts; when he 
committed himself to the ideals of craftsmanship, he found himself 
opposed by the conservative painters of the academy, and when he wanted 
to realize his modern design ideas by smuggling them into the crafts 
programme, the watchful eyes of the Thuringlan parliament demanded to 
see evidence of his loyalty, and only after the exhibition of objects 
designed to please the tastes of Weimar would it promise the continued 
support upon which the school's survival depended. Given this scenario, 
if Gropius had followed the 1919 Manifesto to the letter, and placed the
 fate of the Bauhaus in the hands of technically outstanding master 
craftsmen who were nonetheless insignificant from a national and 
international point of view, the school would not have survived its 
first year. At best it would have turned into an abject, postwar version
 of the former institution directed by van de Velde, surviving reduced 
into a mere department at Max Thedy's popularly approved and thriving 
academy of painting. Whereas Gropius, as he said in his letter to Hardt,
 Intended to bring about 'a great Whole', an autonomous and 
self-governing realm that would become a factor to be reckoned with in 
German culture and on the international scene. For this, politics was 
indispensable, as was the broadest kind of publicity. He needed names 
that would ring a bell; he had to win over artists of the highest renown
 and reputation, whose presence would secure international support - as 
well as members of the younger generation who had made a name for 
themselves in the sphere of the avant-garde. Since he was constantly 
forced to be on the defensive, he had to strive for a position of power;
 the show of strength became a prerequisite of survival, even if such 
strength came from the outside, in the face of the local powers and the 
suffocating public opinion of Weimar. This struggle for power and a 
position of strength was reflected multifold within the school, and set 
the scene for the paradigmatic conflict at the Bauhaus between Gropius 
and Johannes Itten, during the years 1919 to 1922.</p>

      </ul>
      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">4</span>Itten was the 
only one among the Bauhaus masters with pedagogical training - he had 
several years of experience as a teacher and art instructor. He was born
 in 1888 at Süderen-Linden, near Bern, Switzerland, the child of a 
teacher and a peasant girl. Originally intending to be a teacher, in the
 course of his studies at Bern he became familiar with the pedagogic 
reform tradition, the teachings of Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Fröbel and 
Montessori, their empathic and patient methods of education and 
training. In his memoirs he wrote: 'When I first taught in 1908 at the 
elementary school of a Swiss village, I tried to avoid anything which 
would disturb the children's naivety. Almost instinctively I realized 
that all criticism and corrections offend and destroy self-confidence, 
while encouragement and recognition further the growth of abilities.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn3" href="#ftn3">3</a>
 For example, he corrected spelling mistakes by reading the children's 
essays, noting the mistakes, and then writing the misspelled words on 
the blackboard, without mentioning the names of the children who made 
the mistakes. Like Goethe, Itten was also convinced that one of the main
 goals of education is the preservation and fostering of childhood 
genius, of the wholeness and integrity of the child's world view. He saw
 a dangerous force in the rules and regulations of the school system, so
 alien to the child, and in the face of which one had to strive to keep 
the individual values of the child. In Vienna he was not the only one 
with such pedagogical views. At Franz Cizek's private academy there was 
no academic drawing instruction whatever. There, too, first and foremost
 the students' inner impulses were allowed to come to the forefront, and
 they were encouraged to use the most varied materials, which were 
glued, nailed, or the like, to compose pictures. According to some, 
Itten was a follower of Cizek, while in the opinion of others Cizek 
borrowed from Itten.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn4" href="#ftn4">4</a></p>

      </ul>
      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">5</span>As Rainer Wick 
notes, Itten ultimately did not believe in a progamme narrowed down to 
the concept of individuality, for 'by preserving the genius of childhood
 ... he had intended to give a new channel of expression to our entire 
civilization'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn5" href="#ftn5">5</a> In his pedagogy Itten above all strove to avoid a 'sterile intellectualism',<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn6" href="#ftn6">6</a>
 and endeavoured to achieve a balance according to which 'on the one 
hand each child has to be taught so that he may develop along the lines 
of his original, individual character, thereby preserving his 
creativity, while on the other he has to be acquainted with those 
principles of artistic creation that must be mastered if he is to be 
capable of giving form to his original and innovative ideas.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn7" href="#ftn7">7</a>
 Itten constantly held this twofold guideline in view, while keeping the
 personality Itself as the focal point of his pedagogical work, holding 
the preservation and unfolding of the marks of Individual character to 
be of paramount importance. The painter Gyula Pap, who, as a member of 
the Bauhaus from 1920 to 1923, was also one of Itten's students, 
recollects that at the first class meeting Itten asked the students to 
prepare two compositions using their favourite colours. One was to 
consist of spots - colour areas arranged Into shapes obeying the most 
involuntary impulses - and the other to consist of geometric forms. When
 they were finished, the students were asked to stand in a circle 
holding their two colour compositions in front of them. Itten said, 'Now
 take a good look at each other, for never again will you stand so 
nakedly and openly exposed in front of each other.' As Gyula Pap 
remembers it, the colours chosen showed an astonishing consonance with 
the natural hues and intensities of each student's complexion, hair, 
eyes, so that the compositions, to everyone's amazement, indeed seemed 
to convey individual personalities.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn8" href="#ftn8">8</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">6</span>Itten did not 
stay in his post as elementary school teacher. In 1909 he entered the 
Geneva Academy of Art, but became disillusioned with the academic 
teaching methods and returned to Bern, where he studied mathematics, 
physics and chemistry to complete his training as a high school teacher.
 After taking his examinations, he decided to return to painting. Again 
matriculating at Geneva, he spent some time studying geometric form 
elements and their contrasts under the guidance of Professor Eugene 
Gilliard. He credited these studies with enabling him to obtain a grasp 
of 'the basic formal elements of all artistic work'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn9" href="#ftn9">9</a>
 However, the decisive influence on his career came in Stuttgart, where,
 starting in 1913, he studied with Ida Kerkovlus, the student of Adolf 
Hölzel, one of the foremost art educators of the period. (Kerkovius 
later became a pupil of Itten's at the Bauhaus.) At Stuttgart Itten was 
unable to gain admission to the Academy, and Hdlzel, as a professor 
there, was not allowed to take on private students.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn10" href="#ftn10">10</a>
 During the three years spent in Stuttgart, Itten absorbed Hölzel's 
principal teachings: a colour theory based on Goethe's, including the 
colour circle; the theory of light/dark contrasts that preoccupied 
Hdlzel around this time; the method of analysing the works of the 
classical masters of painting, in the course of which the student 
investigates the structure and composition of these works; the mode of 
collaging torn papers, which, during this experimental period of 
Holzel's, formed such an important part of his approach; the gymnastic 
exercises that Hdlzel regularly performed and asked his students to 
perform; and the practice of automatic drawings made in the psychically 
receptive state following these exercises. Itten used every one of these
 elements in his own pedagogical work.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn11" href="#ftn11">11</a>
 In 1916 at the invitation of one of his students he moved to Vienna, 
where he opened an art school which soon became well known in the city. 
He recalled this period in his memoirs: 'We worked on geometric and 
rhythmic forms, problems of proportion and expressive pictorial 
composition ... In addition to the study of polar contrasts, exercises 
promoting relaxation and concentration brought amazing successes. I 
recognized creative automatism as one of the most important factors in 
art. I myself worked on geometric-abstract pictures which were based on 
careful pictorial constructions.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn12" href="#ftn12">12</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">7</span>As mentioned, 
Itten was introduced to Gropius early in 1919 in Vienna by Alma Mahler, 
Gropius's first wife. He immediately accepted Gropius's invitation to 
Weimar. He later wrote: 'I was particularly attracted by the studios and
 workshops and the fact that the Bauhaus was still empty so that the new
 could be built without much tearing down of the old.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn13" href="#ftn13">13</a></p>

be a high priest himself, and in a much stricter sense of the word than 
Gropius. He had come to adopt Mazdaznan, one of the quasi-religious 
movements of the period. Based on the original teachings of Zoroaster in
 Persia, it was popularized after the First World War by Otto Hanisch, a
 Leipzig typographer, who changed his name to Dr Othoman Zar-Adhust 
Ha'nisch; his doctrines might be described as a kind of dualism. The 
creator of light, Ahura Mazda, is in eternal struggle for world 
supremacy against Angra Mainyu, the creator of darkness. The duty of 
humans is to contribute to the victory of light. Mankind becomes fit for
 the task by freeing itself of everything that aids the enemy; expelling
 all gross matter from the body by means of fasting, vegetarianism, an 
ordered lifestyle, and by purging and breathing exercises. In addition, 
meditation is needed to restore inner calm, as well as a refusal to join
 the scurrying rat-race of everyday life.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn15" href="#ftn15">15</a></p>

teachings that Itten passed on, with all the persuasive power of his 
hypnotic and charismatic personality, to the youth of the Bauhaus 
thirsting for a philosophy of life. He had an extraordinary influence. 
He went about wearing a monk's robe (he himself designed the flowing. 
Oriental-style crimson outfit), his head shaven, sporting thin 
wire-rimmed glasses. His students worshipped him; for them, he was 
indeed the revered high priest. Helmuth von Erffa writes: 'We all hoped 
for a better life, and those hopes centred, not around Gropius at first,
 but around Johannes Itten. Gropius might share our simple meals in the 
Bauhaus canteen, but it was Itten who was a leading spirit in those 
early days."<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn16" href="#ftn16">16</a> According to Paul Citroen:</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="citation">There was something demonic about Itten. As a
 master he was either ardently admired or just as ardently hated by his 
opponents, of whom there were many. At all events, it was Impossible to 
ignore him. For those of us who belonged to the Mazdaznan group - a 
unique community within the student body - Itten exuded a special 
radiance. One could almost call it holiness. We were inclined to 
approach him only in whispers; our reverence was overwhelming, and we 
were completely enchanted and happy when he associated with us 
pleasantly and without restraint.<br>When he returned from Herrliberg 
[see note 15], we Mazdaznan boys reached the zenith of fulfilment. There
 were all sorts of gatherings - lectures, exercises, religious services,
 councils, meals - all unbelievably enthusiastic work over the common 
goal of perfection, of the sovereign idea. A jealous community was 
simply unthinkable. And Itten, entrusted with the mysteries of 
reincarnation and other secrets of the doctrine, by virtue of his weeks 
in Herrliberg, was our undisputed master and leader.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn17" href="#ftn17">17</a></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">11</span>In addition to 
Itten's personal emanation, his special position in the curriculum of 
the Bauhaus induced many of the students to consider him to be more than
 just the most effective and significant master of the school. At the 
outset of the new semester following the restoration of the former 
Academy of Fine Art, on 20 September 1920, the Masters' Council held a 
meeting at which Gropius declared that the atmosphere of crisis had to 
yield at last to a workmanlike mood, and he emphatically called the 
faculty's attention to the importance of the dual leadership of the 
workshops. He stated that</p>

        <p class="citation">the Bauhaus Intends to motivate students 
equally from both sides, that of art and that of craft. Since today we 
do not yet possess individuals who move with equal familiarity and at 
sufficiently high levels in both areas, each student has to learn from 
two masters, one of artistic form, the other of technical expertise. The
 most important thing, however, is the combining of these two kinds of 
instruction, something that so far has only occurred in exceptional 
cases. In this area we need to make fundamental changes. It seems that 
we have arrived at the right psychological moment when ... it is

were casting about for a method of determining who was to be admitted to
 the school. Students arrived at Weimar from the most diverse types of 
schools in Germany and other countries, prepared by teaching methods of 
all kinds. Seeing this was the case, Itten proposed to Gropius that a 
Preliminary Course be instituted as a period of probation during which 
it would be possible to form an idea of the student's abilities and 
character. Although Gropius felt that because of administrative 
complications (tuition, meal plan, etc.) provisional admission was not 
realizable, the Preliminary Course was already offered during the first 
semester to matriculated students. At the time it was not a compulsory 
requirement. 'Walter Gropius generously gave me complete freedom with 
the structure and theme of the course,' writes Itten.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn20" href="#ftn20">20</a></p>

which, beginning in the autumn of 1920, was a requirement for every 
student at the Bauhaus, had a threefold task. First, the freeing of the 
creative artistic powers of the students and the loosening of embedded 
stereotypes and conventions; second, facilitation of the choice of 
career, by discovering affinities for certain materials and thereby 
pointing the students towards that workshop in which they could continue
 their training most successfully; and, third, instruction in the 
fundamental principles of design, the basic laws of handicrafts.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn21" href="#ftn21">21</a></p>

classes, in accordance with the teachings of Mazdaznan and the method of
 Adolf Hölzel, began with physical exercises. These breathing and 
gymnastic exercises served to increase awareness of elements analogous 
to artistic expression, such as rhythm, momentum and intensity, and 
brought the students into a state conducive to concentration and 
creative work. This was followed by a loose sequence of improvisational 
and constructive exercises.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn22" href="#ftn22">22</a>
 Itten introduced each quality and compositional element through its own
 contrasts to his students, whose assignments included the most thorough
 experiencing and pictorial representation of contrasts, such as 
large/small, long/short, broad/narrow, thick/thin, much/little, 
straight/curved, pointed/blunt, plane/volume, rough/smooth, hard/soft, 
still/moving, light/heavy, diagonal/circular and fluid/solid. In 
addition there were assignments relating to colour contrasts and various
 textural studies.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn23" href="#ftn23">23</a> Regarding these latter, Itten writes:</p>
    </div>
    <blockquote>

        <p class="citation">I had long chromatic rows of real materials 
made for the tactile judging of different textures. The students had to 
feel these textures with their fingertips, their eyes closed. After a 
short time the sense of touch improved to an amazing degree. I then had 
the students make texture montages of contrasting materials. The effect 
of these fantastic creations was entirely novel at that time. In solving
 these problems the students developed a real designing fever. They 
began to rummage through the drawers of thrifty grandmothers, their 
kitchens and cellars; they ransacked the workshops of craftsmen and the 
rubbish heaps of factories and building sites. A whole new world was 
discovered: lumber and wood shavings, steel wool, wires, strings, 
polished wood, and sheep's wool, feathers, glass and tin foil, grids and
 weaves of all kinds, leather, furs and shiny cans. Manual abilities 
were discovered and new textures invented. They started a mad tinkering,
 and their awakened instincts discovered the inexhaustible wealth of 
textures and their combinations. The students observed that wood could 
be fibrous, dry, rough, smooth or furrowed; that iron could be hard, 
heavy, shiny or dull. Finally they investigated how these textural 
qualities could be represented. These studies were of great value to the
 future architects, craftsmen, photographers, graphic artists and 
industrial designers.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn24" href="#ftn24">24</a></p>

heavy emphasis on developing the ability of drawing accurately from 
nature. 'In order to educate the ability to observe with the utmost 
sharpness and accuracy, the students were assigned to do 
photographically realistic drawings in colour from nature. I intended to
 develop the eye, the hand and the memory, that is, I wanted them to 
know by heart what they saw.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn25" href="#ftn25">25</a>
 Just as important as total fidelity to reality was fidelity to the 
state of mind, to the feelings to be expressed. 'If a genuine feeling is
 to be expressed in a line or a plane, this feeling must first resound 
within the artist. Arm, hand, finger, the whole body, should be 
permeated by this feeling … One of the cardinal principles of the 
Chinese ink painter is "Heart and hand must be one.'"<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn26" href="#ftn26">26</a>
 Music would be playing during Itten's figure-drawing classes, to 
accompany the movements of the model. The aim this time was not exact 
representation, but the expression of the body's movements and rhythms. 
The movements of the hand always had to follow the model's movements.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">17</span>One of the basic 
foundation pillars of Itten's pedagogy was the course in 'analysis of 
the work of old masters'. These analyses were not art-historical but 
were intended to develop sensitivity of seeing contrasts, through 
intense experiencing and empathy. It was not enough that the students 
captured on paper their impressions of paintings by means of stating 
light/dark contrasts, and relationships of weight or rhythm. Itten 
demanded the total emotional absorption of the work. Schlemmer noted in a
 letter:</p>

elements, say, movement, the main line, a curve . . . He shows a Gothic 
figure, and then the weeping Magdalene from the Grünewald Altar. The 
students are working hard to extract the essence of this very 
complicated composition. Itten watches their fumblings, and roars: If 
you had any kind of artistic sensibility, you would not sit there 
drawing in the face of this sublime representation of tears - the sorrow
 of the world - you would be dissolved in tears yourselves! With these

 of the autumn of 1920 Itten in effect took charge of the artistic

 studio and the weaving and printing shops. Prior to this time none of 
the workshops had been under the direction of a specific form master and
 the students could freely choose among them. The new system, as Marcel

prepared for this eventuality: in fact, this is what he had been 
intending all along. Numerous comments in his private correspondence as 
well as several aspects of his activities at the Bauhaus indicate that 
he considered Gropius to be a kind of bureaucrat whom sooner or later he
 would overshadow, so that the Bauhaus would be imbued by his own 
intellectual, spiritual and artistic teachings. Already in the autumn of
 1919 he wrote to a friend from Weimar:</p>

 About one hundred students attend my art-historical analysis class, and
 this is only a portion of all the students signed up with me. I am 
going to wipe the slate clean. For the past week I have been ruling the 
whole Bauhaus - I proposed that we should prepare all sorts of games for
 the coming weeks. Thus in one stroke I have knocked out the traditional
 life-drawing academic approach by leading back all creative activity to
 its roots in play. Those who fail at this in my book fail as artists or
 students. You may imagine how the young people are stirred up by these 
ideas planted in receptive minds. In a word, I have turned the whole 
institute into a flexible, malleable entity, and my task is now to

lines make one wonder whether it was the academic system or the one 
imposed by Gropius that Itten intended to disrupt so as to install his 
own order. Possibly both. The above evidence unequivocally indicates 
that Itten strove from the very beginning to have his influence be the 
definitive one within the school. He worked to have his own markedly 
distinct artistic and theoretical apparatus hold sway. Since he was a 
radical innovator, naturally he did not waste much energy on fighting 
the already vanquished academic tradition, but concentrated instead on 
his rival Gropius's pedagogical activities. Whose new spirit would fill

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">21</span>In the first 
year of the Bauhaus the two men represented approximately equally 
powerful factions. Itten was backed by the spirit of the age, which was 
also well sensed (and exploited) by Gropius, but only as one aspect of a
 long-range strategy, while Itten lived and expressed the present with 
the fullest intensity. Itten could project this prophetic excitement and
 ardour more convincingly not only because of his personal charisma and 
powers of persuasion, but also because of his unreserved identification 
with the spirit of the age, while Gropius, to a certain extent, always 
stayed outside it: he experienced it, but, being temperamentally 
different from the mystics, he first of all <em>comprehended </em>these experiences. In spite of all his torments, he did <em>not </em>convert
 from Saul to Paul; he remained a rationalist throughout, In whose life 
the postwar expressionist-emotional phase remained a brief episode. In 
addition, in contrast to Itten, he had to constantly keep in mind the 
position of the Bauhaus as seen from the outside, from the Weimar, 
Thuringian, national and international perspectives. The years 1919-22 
constituted Itten's era, especially 1920-21, when a veritable wave of 
mysticism swept across Germany. 'Everybody was reading the German 
mystics, Suso, Tauler, Meister Eckhardt, Jakob Böhme, or Buddha's 
sermons, or Lao-Tse. In 1930 a member of the youth movement preached on 
the steps of churches as a new John the Baptist, and later a former 
medal manufacturer, Werner Heuser, with a long beard and in a long, dark
 robe, made fiery speeches on the imitation of Christ to packed houses 
in Weimar. Itten gave him money and lodgings and announced in class

to maintain his position of equal strength vis-à-vis Itten because he 
was the director, and this, in addition to his personal make-up, gave 
him a greater perspective to see, as if from above, the situation Itten 
was in the midst of. Itten's horizon was defined by the glittering goal 
of gaining (informal) supremacy, or decisive influence at least, over 
the Bauhaus; his aim was to become the spiritual leader and ultimate 
authority not only of his religious cult and its doctrines but of the 
entire school. Gropius's horizons were much broader, and he could very 
well see that the trend represented by Itten was nothing more than one 
colour in a palette of many hues. In a paradoxical manner, however, 
Itten's pedagogical activities, notwithstanding his short-range 
ambitions in 'Bauhaus politics', were and remained valuable and 
untainted by any political considerations, while Gropius's activities 
were in the long run always curtailed by the political struggles forced 
on him as director of the Bauhaus.</p>

called a collective, but about a real community. A collective can only 
come about where there is an actual common goal that cannot be achieved 
individually, only collectively. In our school, on the other hand, there
 is a need for subordination, therefore we do not require individual 
efforts, but endeavour to suppress differences of opinion and mutual 
criticism. There are two groups at the Bauhaus: teachers and students. 
We must clarify the position of the students. It is high time that we

 'The community creates itself, it is bom of need, and cannot be created
 by speeches,' he said.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn32" href="#ftn32">32</a>
 Then, in answer to Muche's unstated qualms, he went on: 'Everyone must 
exercise greater self-discipline. As for art, the less said about it, 
the better. Art must come about of itself. The results of the past year 
demonstrate that the students oppose anything they see as constraint and
 regulation. This kind of neurasthenia is understandable, but we must 
pass beyond it. Towards this end, we must see to it that students 
unconditionally submit to the master they have chosen, instead of 
sporadically attending lectures and criticizing everything.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn33" href="#ftn33">33</a></p>

 in the agreeable role of the teacher defending the students' interests

Bauhaus, had managed to find Gropius's Achilles' heel.</p>

another staunch supporter in the person of Gertrud Grunow, an eccentric 
autodidact in her fifties, who sought out Itten in November 1919 
proposing to give lectures at the Bauhaus about harmony. Itten wrote in a
 letter: 'At first I was somewhat sceptical, but after some wrangling I 
decided to persuade my students to sign up for her lectures. I myself 
sat in on her class and thought she was quite good on certain matters … 
Her judgment is sound, but I think she is mistaken in many respects. I 
am going to keep a sharp eye on her.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn37" href="#ftn37">37</a>
 It is not clear how Itten had the 'authority' to admit Gertrud Grunow 
to the Bauhaus. The students did not take to her with the same degree of
 enthusiasm as he did. As Helmuth von Erffa writes: 'The most severe 
attacks against our personalities came in the form of Miss Gertrud 
Grunow's dance exercises. She was convinced that she could place us, the
 students, by means of music and a self-induced trance state, into an 
inner equilibrium that would strengthen and harmonize our creative 
powers.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn38" href="#ftn38">38</a> 'She
 made the extravagant claim of being able to develop any faculty 
whatsoever. "I could teach you boxing, too," she told a classmate of

less effective manner, with less than Itten's considerable reservoir of 
personality, she represented the doctrines of the supremacy of 
intuition, empathy and inner concentration. She was Itten's helper and

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">29</span>There was one 
other artist at the Bauhaus between 1920 and 1923 who may be counted as 
one of Itten's circle: Lothar Schreyer, 'a mystic, born in Saxony like 
the early seventeenth-century mystic and philosophical theologian Jakob 
Böhme.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn40" href="#ftn40">40</a> 
Schreyer was a painter and poet, and was working on the creation of a 
new type of theatre. In 1918 he founded the Sturm-Bühne in Berlin, an 
experimental expressionist theatre, but in 1919 moved from the hectic 
metropolis to Hamburg, where the theatre continued under the name of 
Kampfbühne. Schreyer's expressionist productions should be approached 
not from the direction of the theatre, but from the viewpoints of visual
 art and expressionist poetry. Although the productions followed 
carefully prepared scenarios, they must have been actually closer to the
 medium labelled <em>performance art </em>in our days. He was primarily 
dependent on Kandinsky's theories of a theater based on inner resonances
 and musical and colouristic movements.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn41" href="#ftn41">41</a>
 Larger-than-life figures, symbolizing ideas, moved on Schreyer's stage.
 The performers declaimed their lyrics from behind abstract-geometric 
masks covering their entire bodies. Schreyer strove to enlarge the 
visions appearing on his stage into grandiose dramatic tableaux. He 
focused all of his means to achieve a meeting of actors and audience 
within a shared, elevated mystical-cultic experience.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn42" href="#ftn42">42</a>
 He banished dialogue from his theatre: rhythms and timbre, volume and 
pitch differentiated the sequences of shouts, wails, chants and 
incantations that made up the brunt of sound effects on stage. The 
score- or scenario-like <em>Spielgang </em>on which the production was based recalls a way of thought not unlike Itten's.</p>

 One of the members of the theatre workshop, Hans Haffenrichter, recalls
 that the most important part of preparation was that the players should
 experience the <em>inner resonance. </em>'The words of the poem were 
strictly rehearsed in the rhythm and bar of the "Spielgang" and in the 
pitch and intensity of the Klangsprechen until the "spiritual dimension"
 became actuality.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn45" href="#ftn45">45</a></p>

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">32</span>'Moonplay', 
Schreyer's last, and failed, Bauhaus production (1923), was a brief 
masque with an incoherent text of 346 lines, performed by two players 
whose bodies were completely hidden behind masks ('dance shields'). The 
female player, Maria in the Moon, was the embodiment of the cosmic 
principle of salvation, order, goodness; the male player, the Moon 
Dancer, expressed his devotion to her. He, too, was a cosmic apparition.
 Maria was a larger-than-life - part plaster and part papier mâché - 
painted figure, open in the back, concealed behind which the performer 
declaimed her text. At various moments of the performance the Dancer, 
his entire body covered by a stiff mask, bowed down at Maria's feet. 
(Haffenrichter was coached in the movements by Gertrud Grunow.) A 'moon 
eye' was painted in the centre of the mask. The dancer had to turn 
around his own axis and move up and down along a vertical axis. In his 
memoirs Haffenrichter describes that while working on the two-metre-high
 Maria mask, the workshop students felt more and more imbued by the 
essence of artistic creation, and became convinced that they had to 
reach as far back as the primal origins of the theatre, back to the 
birth of tragedy. Thus they arrived at Nietzsche's work, just like the 
founders of Die Brücke and so many German Expressionists. Like them. 
Schreyer intended to create a theatrical imprint of the sense of 
national tragedy, a drama moved by the irrational forces of German 
history and fate. Schreyer did not turn to pseudo-religions such as 
Mazdaznan, but sought the sources of renewal in a Christian experience 
raised to the pitch of exaltation. His lectures were meant to affect 
students by their suggestive powers of inspiration and emotion-transfer,
 and in this respect they were quite close to Itten's pedagogical 
methods.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">33</span>Muche, Gertrud 
Grunow, and even Schreyer served only as accompaniment to the most 
significant phenomenon of the Bauhaus in 1920: the life of the Mazdaznan
 community. By means of this small community Itten realized precisely 
that idea of 'small, secret self-contained associations, lodges' 
mentioned by Gropius in his speech during the summer of 1919. However, 
Gropius would have had the entire Bauhaus form itself into such an 
intimate community, instead of having it split into factions. Naturally 
he had meant a community working under the shared Bauhaus idea, under 
the leadership of the director.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">34</span>It was around 
this time, in the years 1920-21, that the first building embodying a 
more or less collective Bauhaus effort was built: the house of the 
lumber dealer Adolf Sommerfeld in Berlin-Dahlem. The commission was 
received through Gropius's private architectural office, and the house 
was constructed on a fieldstone foundation out of the only available 
building material: teak-wood salvaged from a scuttled warship purchased 
by Sommerfeld. Although it was a far cry from the representative and 
symbolic nature of the shining cathedral depicted on the Manifesto's 
cover, this house was nonetheless a kind of unified work of art and as 
such served to illustrate the Bauhaus programme. Gropius and Meyer, on 
this occasion, allowed themselves to be influenced by Frank Lloyd 
Wright.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn46" href="#ftn46">46</a> The 
horizontal articulation enhancing the visual impression created by 
horizontal beams, and the projecting support beams, result in 'a 
dramatized version and rustic translation of Frank Lloyd Wright's 
earliest prairie houses'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn47" href="#ftn47">47</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">35</span>Bauhaus members
 contributed the interior details of the house: Josef Albers designed 
the stained glass windows, Joost Schmidt the wood relief panels, and 
some of the furniture was designed and executed by Marcel Breuer as his 
examination piece. Alfred Forbát, employed by Gropius's design office, 
supervised the finishing touches, and he designed the garage and the 
chauffeur's house near the rear entrance to the garden;<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn48" href="#ftn48">48</a>
 this latter is still extant, but the rest of the building was destroyed
 during the war. Albers's stained glass windows and Joost Schmidt's wood
 carvings employed geometric, abstract patterns. Schmidt's commission 
specifically included the illustration of towns where Sommerfeld owned 
lumberyards, with the names of the towns carved in. On the basis of the 
surviving photos, the Interior of the house, offering a broad spectrum 
of the uses of wood In Interior decoration, presented a novel 
appearance, made highly unusual by the contrast between the warmth and 
cosiness of the materials and the coolly objective spirit of the 
abstract geometric ornamentation.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">36</span>Sommerfeld did 
the greatest service to the Bauhaus by commissioning its members with 
the design and execution of this building. He was so satisfied with it 
that he entrusted Gropius with further commissions, and subsequently 
proved to be the one reliable patron of the Bauhaus. Frank Whitford 
notes that the fact that Sommerfeld, a Berlin resident, gave this 
exceptional opportunity to the school for summing up the state of its 
art at the time is eloquent proof that this type of enlightened 
patronage was a <em>sine qua non </em>of the Bauhaus's survival. It was a
 pity that such a commission had to come from far-off Berlin. Whitford 
considers it a shortcoming of the Bauhaus that old-fashioned handicrafts
 were allowed to triumph in this building, without the least trace of 
more advanced technologies; he also notes with disapproval that the 
commission had to come through Gropius's private architectural office.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn49" href="#ftn49">49</a>
 All this is indisputably true, but only as a result of a whole series 
of such projects would the Bauhaus have been in a position to receive 
direct commissions. However, Sommerfeld remained an isolated example. 
The Sommerfeld house was Indeed an expressive building, within its own 
limits; both its exterior effects and its interior decor created 
dramatic light/dark contrasts, while the geometric decorative elements 
resolved into asymmetric, disquietlngly vibrant patterns. In a way they 
resembled expressionist woodcuts, just as certain elements of Schreyer's
 stage sets did.</p>
