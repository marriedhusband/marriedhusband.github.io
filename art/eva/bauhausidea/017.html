      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">1</span>'SOME TIME ago, 
among other papers pertaining to the Bauhaus period, I found a diary 
that my wife kept from 1923 to 1928 and that we had not looked at since.
 I began to read and the further I went the more depressed I became, for
 it became clear from the text that about 90 per cent of the 
unprecedented efforts made by all participants in this undertaking went 
into countering national and local hostility, and only 10 per cent 
remained for actual creative work,' wrote Gropius shortly before his 
death.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn1" href="#ftn1">1</a> These 
struggles, as Gropius so clearly noted in hindsight, no matter how 
passionate and romantic they had been at the outset, also brought about,
 beside the visible end-results of moral victory and practical failure, 
the slow and steady erosion of energies.</p>

Gropius composed a new programme for the new life of the new institute 
among new circumstances, but, in line with the lower case outlook that 
now affected his thinking, he no longer called it a manifesto, not even a
 programme. He gave the plain title <em>Bauhaus Dessau - Principles of Bauhaus Production</em><a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn2" href="#ftn2">2</a> to the text published as a leaflet, in which he once and for all designated design as the task of the Bauhaus.</p>

        <p class="citation">The creation of standard types for all 
practical commodities of everyday use is a social necessity. On the 
whole, the necessities of life are the same for the majority of people. 
The home and its furnishings are mass consumer goods, and their design 
is more a matter of reason than a matter of passion. The machine 
-capable of producing standardized products - is an effective device, 
which, by means of mechanical aids - steam and electricity - can free 
the individual from working manually for the satisfaction of his daily 
needs and can provide him with mass-produced products that are cheaper 
and better than those manufactured by hand. There is no danger that 
standardization will force a choice upon the individual, since due to 
natural competition the number of available types of each object will 
always be abundant enough to provide the individual with a choice of 
design that suits him best.<br>The Bauhaus workshops are essentially 
laboratories in which prototypes of products suitable for mass 
production and typical of our time are carefully developed and 
constantly improved. In these laboratories the Bauhaus wants to train a 
new kind of collaborator for industry and the crafts, who has an equal 
command of both technology and form. To reach the objective of creating a
 set of standard prototypes which meet all the demands of economy, 
technology, and form, requires the selection of the best, most 
versatile, most thoroughly educated men who are imbued with an exact 
knowledge of the design elements of form and mechanics and their 
underlying laws … The Bauhaus will fight against the cheap substitute, 
inferior workmanship, and the dilettantism of the handicrafts, for a new
 standard of quality work.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn3" href="#ftn3">3</a></p>

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">3</span>Gropius published 
this programme declaration indebted to early Werkbund Ideals in March 
1926. Perhaps as a counter-proposal, Kandinsky published a text in the 
December 1926 issue of <em>bauhaus, </em>entitled 'The Value of 
Theoretical Instruction in Painting'. In this piece, Kandinsky places in
 the focus of Bauhaus training the very motifs Gropius had ignored in 
his programme. His thrust is unmistakably aimed at the latter:</p>

the means and the simultaneously conscious and unconscious activity with

 unnatural and repulsive ... In practice, extreme specialization

synthesis. I hope I need not prove a number of facts generally known 
today: for example, the recognition of laws in the composition of 
paintings. Yet, for the student to acknowledge this basic fact is not in
 itself sufficient - it must be implanted inside the student and it must
 be done with such thoroughness that the knowledge of this fact enters 
into his fingertips all by itself. The most moderate or the most 
powerful 'dream' of the artist has actually little or no value as long 
as his fingertips are incapable of following the 'dictates' of this 
dream with the utmost precision ... An understanding of the laws of 
nature is absolutely necessary for the artist. But this simple fact is 
still entirely unknown to the art academies.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn4" href="#ftn4">4</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">4</span>The conflict 
between Gropius and Kandinsky was an inherent opposition just as Gropius
 and Itten's had been, but at least until the 1923 exhibition the 
emotions were relegated into the background by the mutual willingness to
 cooperate and the shared task of keeping the Bauhaus alive. This was 
all the more so since Kandinsky's professed belief in the synthetic work
 of art as well as his attempts at a <em>Gesamtkunstwerk </em>on the 
stage were in close spiritual relation to the 1919 Bauhaus ideal that 
was still in effect when Kandinsky accepted Gropius's invitation. 
However, after the declaration of the 'new unity' of art and technology,
 the two men grew apart at an increasing rate. Their behaviour towards 
each other wore a thinning veneer of mutual tolerance. Already in 1925 
Gropius had written in a letter to his wife: 'Last night at the 
Kandinskys', both of them are fat, sun-tanned and rested. I am sorry to 
see that both they and Klee are increasingly considering the Bauhaus as a
 sinecure - alas, another disappointment'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn5" href="#ftn5">5</a>
 The disappointment was only partially justifiable, since, as we may 
recall, back in the Weimar days Gropius had invited Klee and Kandinsky 
largely in order to upgrade the school's image - as 'persons well known 
in the outside world' whose presence would be important 'even if deep 
down we do not as yet fully understand them'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn6" href="#ftn6">6</a>
 However, since those Weimar days history had in a sense pulled the rug 
from under Gropius's feet, or, more specifically, had taken some of the 
novelty from his Bauhaus concept. By now the entire German economy was 
operating on the ground rules of inexpensive, rational, efficient 
production, naturally taking the form of prototypes and mass production.
 This, as a programme, no longer required for its fulfilment a rebel 
with a sense of mission, ready to set a personal example. It is no 
accident that Gropius in his Dessau programme statement stressed <em>quality, a </em>word
 that he had not resorted to with such emphasis since his early Werkbund
 days; quality was the only category left that could still mean an 
ethical superiority vis-à-vis manufacturers solely motivated by profit. 
It was also true, however, that the requirement of quality contradicted 
the principles of low cost and efficiency. Gropius no longer employed 
the word art, but we may with good reason suppose that by quality he 
meant the presence of art. In other words, according to his programme, 
the Bauhaus would produce objects (or designs) that would reflect the 
many-sidedness and rich imagination characterizing the members of the 
Bauhaus.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">5</span>Still, we must 
note that by the second half of the Twenties much of the energy that 
stemmed from confrontation and the related sense of mission had in fact 
evaporated. Efficiency of production, and the corresponding design 
culture, irrevocably permeated the recovering German economy, so that 
individual self-expression had again come to seem rebellious. The 
passion and romantic aura surrounding the collective creative work had 
evaporated, and again, although as yet barely overtly, came to be 
associated with the individual work of creation. Gropius's concept, it 
seemed, had won a Pyrrhic victory. The principle itself conquered 
society in such a way that it became absorbed by it ('Bauhaus style', 
Ernd Kdllai would proclaim two years later). As for the ethical surplus 
concentrated in the principle of <em>quality, </em>in practice it only burdened the image of the Bauhaus with a cachet of exclusiveness and elitism.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">6</span>Klee and Kandinsky
 on the one hand, and Gropius on the other, represented two widely 
divergent creative and historical attitudes. It was Gropius's outlook, 
that of identifying with the present social order, that stood to lose. 
It had been proved that the unity of art and technology was nothing more
 than an empty play on words, and that the Bauhaus, in spite of all its 
successful products and stockpile of intellectual and artistic capital, 
had been able to share with the rest of society only the most 
superficial layers of its productivity, it had also become quite 
apparent that although friendly and creative communities existed within 
the school, the Bauhaus as a whole had not jelled into one large 
community, following the illusions of 1919.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">7</span>In addition, 
although the Bauhaus in Dessau had built its school complex and masters'
 residences, the financial position of the school in 1926 was, if 
anything, even worse than it had been in Weimar. This, naturally, helped
 to sharpen the emerging dichotomies. The Bauhaus did not always receive
 the payments due for industrial orders; in spite of much debate, the 
moneys refused to accrue with regularity. The town itself was not in a 
financial position to support the school. The Bauhaus did gain in 
prestige, so that when the issue of professorial titles for the masters 
again arose (Klee and Kandinsky definitely wanted it), the State 
Ministry of Anhalt granted the Bauhaus university status on 1 October 
1926. From then on the masters were titled professors, and the Masters' 
Council became the Conference. With this, the Bauhaus took another 
significant step towards integration with society: the masters now 
accepted the academic title that Gropius, perhaps under the influence of
 Bartning and the Arbeitsrat's ideals, had so proudly refused in 1922.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn7" href="#ftn7">7</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">8</span>By the end of 
August 1926 the desperate financial picture of the Bauhaus forced 
Gropius to take a surprising step. He asked his faculty to donate 10 per
 cent of their salaries for a transitional period to help the Bauhaus 
survive. Most of them were willing to do this; Klee and Kandinsky, 
however, adamantly rejected the proposal. This event might confuse the 
historian - after all, what entitles us to look into the personal 
finances of artists? However, we may feel justified, given the moment in
 time and the nature of the conflict between the very individuals whose 
personal data may reveal the depth of the rift that developed from the 
fault line between the artists of the Bauhaus and its design-oriented 
leadership. Otherwise the event would hardly possess any significance 
for us. Klee wrote to Gropius on his own and Kandinsky's behalf, closing
 his letter with, 'I look gloomily ahead to further negotiations and am 
afraid of something that was avoided even during the worst phase at 
Weimar: an inner disruption.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn8" href="#ftn8">8</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">9</span>Gropius answered
 in no uncertain terms about six weeks later, a delay unusual for him:

    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">10</span>Although Klee had
 the reputation of being a stickler in matters of money, it would appear
 that money was not the central issue in this episode. Rather, it was 
the relationship of Gropius and the two painters, or, if you will, that 
of technology and art, which was not cohesive enough to keep the Bauhaus
 sufficiently unified for a conflict-free resolution of this otherwise 
not overly dramatic situation. This time it was not indirectly, through 
signs and impressions, but through a clear-cut message - Klee and 
Kandinsky's refusal of his request - that Gropius was made to 
understand: the Bauhaus no longer meant the same to them as to him. 
Nearly thirty years later ise Gropius wrote in a letter:</p>
    <blockquote>

        </ul>
        <p class="citation">In their behaviour at the time I see that 
they caused disappointment as human beings, and evidence that they never
 really understood Walter's ideas… The Bauhaus... was not established in
 order to give a few remarkable painters the financial independence to 
live entirely for their art. Of course they had an extremely important 
effect on the school, but the danger existed that their art would become
 even more insularized and thereby lose its fertilizing aspect. Had it 
been a matter of Klee and Kandinsky offering some other solution to the 
situation, this would have been an entirely different problem. It was 
their abstention, their withdrawal, their non-participation, that we 
objected to and found antithetical to the spirit of the Bauhaus.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn10" href="#ftn10">10</a></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">11</span>Soon a new 
conflict arose: in early 1927 Gropius wanted to share some of his 
responsibilities and official duties with the masters by delegating some
 of these tasks to them. He wrote a circular letter to the masters, 
which was left unanswered for a long time, without even being returned 
with the signatures of those who had read and acknowledged it. When 
Gropius began to investigate the trail of the letter, he found that 
Moholy-Nagy haa handed it to Muche, the latter to Breuer, where the 
tracks were lost. Breuer excused himself, citing his busy schedule; 
other addressees of the letter, Kandinsky among them, stated that they 
had never seen it. Gropius wrote Kandinsky another letter, in which he 
asked for cooperation in an almost desperate tone:</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">12</span>Of course we 
should consider the situation of Gropius and the Bauhaus in its entire 
complexity, embedded in the circumstances of Dessau and of Germany, to 
appreciate the factors that quenched the inner conviction that had 
fuelled Gropius to do everything within his power - schemes, diplomatic 
manoeuvres within and without the Bauhaus - in order to keep the 
institution going. The Increasingly undeniable fact that the Bauhaus, in
 spite of the rising quality of its workshop production, failed to weld 
into the organic collective willing to make sacrifices for the communal 
goal that had been one of Gropius's chief aims, had a demoralizing 
effect. The common goal, as a result of the exhausting efforts to eke 
out an existence for the school, became the survival of the school 
itself. In the Increasingly right-wing atmosphere at Dessau the Bauhaus 
now had a growing and malicious camp of opponents, just like In Weimar. 
Even Mayor Fritz Hesse, who had been the number one patron of the 
Bauhaus, came to have a strained relationship with Gropius, as a result 
of the latter's frequent trips and subsequent unavailability at his 
office. On one occasion the mayor even threatened to deduct the days 
that Gropius absented himself on non-Bauhaus business from his vacation 
time.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn12" href="#ftn12">12</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">13</span>To all these 
circumstances further disappointments were added. Already in 1927 
Gropius had begun to consider the matter of his own successor - the 
statement about the untenability of his situation in the letter to 
Kandinsky was no empty threat. At first he might have had Marcel Breuer 
in mind, whom he considered his most talented student (and whom he had 
already, at the time of the move to Dessau, recalled to the Bauhaus from
 Paris).<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn13" href="#ftn13">13</a> 
However, Breuer entangled him in a most difficult situation. Quite 
understandably Gropius considered it extremely important that objects 
produced at the Bauhaus should be propagated as the intellectual and 
factual property of the school. Beyond the industrial contacts and the 
profit these meant, these objects were expected to gradually cohere into
 that image of the Bauhaus which corresponded to Gropius's conceptions 
and to reality as well. However Breuer, who, learning to ride his 
bicycle upon his arrival in Dessau, stumbled upon the idea of tubular 
steel furniture,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn14" href="#ftn14">14</a>
 came to disappoint Gropius perhaps even more harshly than the painting 
masters. After all design, and furniture design at that, was par <em>excellence </em>a
 Bauhaus activity, and Gropius had not only admired and encouraged 
Breuer at the time of the latter's experimenting with the evolution of 
various tubular chair prototypes, but had ordered large quantities of 
these for the new Bauhaus building and for the masters' residences. And 
just when the Bauhaus was concluding negotiations in Dresden for the 
marketing of these chairs, Gropius found out that Breuer, who considered
 tubular furniture to be totally his own intellectual property, had made
 prior arrangements with the Berlin firm of Standard-Möbel Lengyel Co. 
In other words Breuer Intended to market independently the furniture 
series which, by his own admission, had been conceived and developed at 
the Bauhaus, and had so many ties to the institution. He intended to 
market the series not as a Bauhaus product designed by him, but as his 
own, independent design. He had conducted secret negotiations with the 
Berlin firm, bringing Dr König, representing the Bauhaus in Dresden, 
into a most embarrassing situation, for the latter had been basing the 
success of his negotiations on the Breuer designs, which promised to be 
the most marketable and commercially successful items.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn15" href="#ftn15">15</a>
 When he was taken to task, Breuer replied: 'The chair was not a Bauhaus
 product in the sense that a painting by Paul Klee was not a Bauhaus 
product. [Klee's painting] was done in his own time and with his own 
money, in his own workshop. To that extent it was not a Bauhaus 
product.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn16" href="#ftn16">16</a></p>

      </ul>
      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">14</span>This way of 
thinking drove Gropius to despair, and with good cause. Breuer may have 
been right about the facts - although these were much more applicable in
 Klee's case than in regard to Breuer's furniture -however, his way of 
thinking meant that among the leading intellectual lights of the Bauhaus
 there was not the least evidence of community spirit, or even of a 
claim for such. Individual oeuvres were being constructed in parallel, 
careers aimed at personal success, and the Bauhaus, from being the 
object of a collective passion, paled into a service enterprise in the 
background, as far as the leading personalities were involved. The 
isolation of Klee and Kandinsky, the manifest individualism of Breuer, 
unequivocally demonstrated that the communality of intellectual property
 was a mere pipedream. Gropius was forced to acknowledge this, and in 
response, as far as his administrative duties and his obligations as 
member in a great number of professional organizations'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn17" href="#ftn17">17</a>
 allowed, he, too, began to give more time to his architectural 
practice. In 1926 he began negotiations with the Dutch architect Mart 
Stam for heading a department of architecture to be established at the 
Bauhaus. Although Stam was only 28 years old, Gropius looked to him as a
 possible successor. However, Stam did not accept the offer.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">15</span>Meanwhile, work
 was proceeding on the construction of the Törten housing project near 
Dessau. The Junkers aircraft factory had supported the invitation of the
 Bauhaus to Dessau because it needed low-cost housing for its workers, 
and the concept of the new-style housing projects in general was of 
interest to the town.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn18" href="#ftn18">18</a>
 A site was at last purchased in the village of Törten along the highway
 to Leipzig, where the Bauhaus gave spectacular proof of the 
capabilities of perfectly coordinated organization. As a result of 
installing an on-site assembly line and the precise timing of work 
phases, in less than three months Gropius was able to deliver for 
occupancy the first two units completely equipped and furnished, at the 
same time as the new Bauhaus buildings were opened. In spite of a few 
flaws in design,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn19" href="#ftn19">19</a> the dwelling units were a tremendous achievement, and the enlargement of the Torten project went on until 1928.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">16</span>It would appear
 that Gropius did not have any intention of directing the architecture 
workshop, for after Mart Stam's refusal he continued his search. The 
designs of a young Swiss architect, Hannes Meyer, aroused Gropius's 
interest, and he was invited for a meeting at the Bauhaus at the end of 
1926. Meyer gave a talk at the Bauhaus on 21 December 1926, and was well
 received.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn20" href="#ftn20">20</a> 
Two designs by Meyer and his associate, Hans Wittwer, were also known: 
their projects for the Petersschule in Basel and for the League of 
Nations Palace in Geneva. Gropius found both of these noteworthy. 
According to his biographer, Reginald Isaacs, it was not primarily 
Meyer's qualifications as architect, but his social commitment that 
attracted Gropius. In 1926 Das <em>Werk </em>In Zurich published Meyer's personal manifesto, 'The New World',<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn21" href="#ftn21">21</a>
 in which some of the Ideas and even a few sentences and turns of phrase
 literally recalled the writings of Gropius in his younger days. Meyer 
wrote: 'The new world of form is known by its lucid construction ... The
 artist's studio turns into a scientific laboratory, and his works are 
the results of a pointed manner of thought and inventiveness … The new 
creation is a collective work, suitable for everyone, and not the object
 of art collections, not the privilege of a few.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn22" href="#ftn22">22</a>
 Meyer, who was 37 years old at the time, represented a type of 
radicalism that Gropius had grown too exhausted to carry on. To him, 
Meyer could have meant a hope that there still existed a grandiloquent 
way of thinking that looked ahead into the future, far past individual 
interests. 'The New World' was in fact a programme-like statement - many
 of its sentences were reiterated by Meyer in later, actual programme 
declarations, and many of the ideas sketched out in it, in spite of the 
at times brutal wording, were pointing in the same direction as 
Gropius's ideas.</p>

Schlemmer saw him at the time: 'Hannes Meyer is also here ... He 
obviously made a good impression, and one had the sense he could

said that what impressed him most here were the pictures (mine and 
Moholy's), not the rooms in which they were hung ... He was not

Feininger does not appeal to him, either. Kandinsky because of the

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">19</span>From the 
distance of nearly three decades this is how Gropius recalled Meyer: 
'Meyer, when he arrived, seemed to be very cooperative and amiable, but 
he was the opposite of open-minded, extremely cautious, and nobody 
really knew him because he did not show his colours … Since I was aware 
of the political difficulties of that time, I asked him point blank 
about his leanings, and he answered that he was politically entirely 
disinterested ... No Indications of his leftish inclinations became 
apparent ... His work in that time was straightforward, and since I 
believe that as soon as a man has been appointed he should have his own 
way, I did not interfere.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn26" href="#ftn26">26</a>
 Meyer elaborated a system of architectural training, and he himself 
taught theory of architecture. He was primarily concerned with housing 
in relation to its environment: the house in its symbiosis with the 
surroundings and various functions, from fruit trees through health 
issues to traffic.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn27" href="#ftn27">27</a>
 'While Walter Gropius was still Bauhaus director, he had a chance to 
observe Hannes Meyer's activities at the school for almost a year, and 
there was nothing in Meyer's manner, statements or his work that 
suggested his inner turbulence or his political intent,'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn28" href="#ftn28">28</a> writes Reginald Isaacs.</p>

meantime, attacks on the Bauhaus aimed at the person of Gropius 
continued at an increased intensity during 1927. These came from 
political opponents, commercial interests, and, as in Weimar, groups of 
academic artists. Satirical newspaper commentaries and cartoons 
ridiculing both Gropius and the school were published in the Dessau 
newspapers.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn29" href="#ftn29">29</a> Public opinion In Dessau clamoured that it had had enough of the 'extravagances of the new architectural style'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn30" href="#ftn30">30</a> Gropius was most deeply offended by an assault made by Heinrich Peus, the publisher of the Dessau daily <em>Dessauer Volksblatt. </em>At
 a meeting Peus charged Gropius with obtaining an unfair honorarium for 
the construction of the Törten housing project, thus inciting the 
dissatisfied tenants' group against the architect. Gropius responded 
with unwonted sharpness and emotion. He wrote a letter to Peus demanding
 that it be published, then he personally went to the publisher's office
 to effect a retraction of the libels. After leaving Peus's office he 
picked up that day's edition of the <em>Volksblatt </em>only to find 
another article containing a libellous attack on his person, signed by 
Peus. 'After leaving your office, I read your article in today's <em>Volksblatt. </em>After this, it becomes very difficult for me to give credence to your words.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn31" href="#ftn31">31</a>
 Peus did not publish Gropius's letter, which he answered breezily:

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">21</span>According to 
Isaacs, on this day, Tuesday, 17 January 1928, Walter Gropius, after

 Moreover, its financial situation had improved notably, but the 
exacerbation of the political picture (the 1927 elections brought in a

his person reinforced Gropius in his decision. During confidential 
discussions with Fritz Hesse,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn34" href="#ftn34">34</a>
 and in the official letter of resignation addressed to the mayor, 
Gropius designated Hannes Meyer as his successor as director of the 
Bauhaus. 'I realized that his decision was irrevocable,' wrote Fritz 
Hesse, who, according to Gropius's biographer, must have felt relief at 
the prospect of from now on having to deal with, instead of the

predictable to the bureaucrat's eye.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">26</span>The historical 
experiences of the second half of the Twenties are embodied In Gropius's
 painful, exhausted act of resignation from the Bauhaus. The Bauhaus, 
apart from all of Gropius's personal ambitions, was an initiative 
towards a collective future, and only a faith in that future could 
provide the energies needed to fight its way through obstacles perceived
 as temporary at the time. Gropius's extraordinary sensitivity to 
historical change had enabled the Bauhaus to adapt itself with the 
biological certainty of a living organism to its rapidly changing 
environment; now this sensitivity signalled a new, alien type of danger.
 The affair that occurred between him and Peus could not have taken 
place in the culture that Gropius was bom and raised in Peus's behaviour
 had called Gropius's attention to an astounding shift in everyday 
realities: a respected artist-Intellectual holding a high official 
position could be publicly insulted and dishonoured without anyone 
taking a stand by his side, without the Chief Mayor or his own 
colleagues demanding justice on his behalf. And without himself having 
any recourse to redress - without even the offending party agreeing to 
discuss the matter with him. We are not mistaken in judging this episode
 as pointing far beyond itself, and it is no accident that it took this 
perhaps in itself insignificant act of arrogance to impress upon Gropius
 the uselessness of writing another circular letter to ask for the 
support of German or European intellectuals. It was impossible not to 
see that Peus stood for the underworld that was in the process of coming
 into power. No matter in what manner he had to present this to himself,
 Gropius at last understood that the cause was no more. For his closest 
associates, or for Germany at large, it made little difference whether 
the Bauhaus would realize its idealistic aims. In the face of the 
rapidly advancing political right, a powerful left arose in a 
polarization of forces and emotions. (Even the otherwise moderately 
leftist weekly <em>Die Weltbuhne </em>sought the collaboration of the Social Democrats.)<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn42" href="#ftn42">42</a> As for the arts, the slogan became Neue <em>Sachlichkeit </em>('New
 Objectivity'), the first exhibition of which was introduced by the 
following words: 'That which is shown here is simply this: the artists, 
who are disappointed, sobered, often resigned to the point of cynicism, 
and almost self-denying with the passage of those moments of boundless, 
nearly apocalyptic hopes, are now, in the midst of catastrophe, thinking
 in terms of what is most immediate, certain and permanent - truth and 
handiwork.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn43" href="#ftn43">43</a></p>
