    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">1</span>THE PROCESSES that
 took place In the Bauhaus after 1923 became increasingly crystallized 
around the ideal of the 'perfect technician'. It is obvious that by this
 time the meanings of the words <em>individuum </em>and <em>collective - </em>at
 least in their everyday usage - had altered in a way closely related to
 the new worldview and value system emerging at the Bauhaus. In 1918-19 
the word <em>individuum </em>referred to bourgeois narrow-mindedness and
 egotism, against which the artist/intellectual, striving for 
social-cultural rebirth, set up the ideal of a utopian collective, 
albeit this Ideal was interpreted in various ways by various groups. As 
we have seen, the Bauhaus ideal at the outset was a creative community 
based on the internal egalitarianism of shared tasks, in temporary 
sequestration from the rest of society - an experimental workshop that 
would transform itself into a <em>workable prototype </em>before 
rejoining the rest of society. This Utopian goal was in part invalidated
 by the changed times, and in part by the fact that the Bauhaus had not 
evolved into an architectural community or workshop of builders. Another
 factor was the person of Johannes Itten and his value system, which 
played a decisive role in the Bauhaus of 1920-21, placing the expressive
 power and wealth of the personality at the fountainhead of creative 
work. Thus, increased value came to be placed on individual performance 
at the Bauhaus, in opposition to the spirit of the founding Manifesto. 
The consequent internal imbalances endangered the very survival of the 
school.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">2</span>This was 
demonstrated at the exhibition mounted in the summer of 1922, when the 
Weimar public approved of the works shown by the reinstated Academy of 
Fine Arts, while rejecting the Bauhaus works. The Bauhaus was unable to 
change this situation; it never succeeded in winning over the local 
community. The works exhibited by the academicians were of course 
individualistic creations, the products of the very philosophy that 
Gropius had labelled 'the academy's cult of genius'. But it was this 
aesthetic that the Weimar public identified with, accepting it as 
representative of the community at large; while this same public failed 
to recognize an image of itself in the works of the Bauhaus artists, and
 rejected any notion of identifying with them. So the Bauhaus could not 
hope for any contact with the community via its painters. On the 
contrary, if it intended to survive, such contact had to be sought in a 
more neutral sphere, by way of handcrafted objects that would presumably
 refrain from provoking Weimar sensibilities. Therefore it makes sense 
that the chief event of the 1923 exhibition was the Haus am Horn, and 
the show of paintings and sculptures at the Landesmuseum took the lowest
 rank in the order of events. The new values evolving at the Bauhaus, 
proclaimed by Gropius on the occasion of the exhibition, held personal 
expression to be less significant than objects produced by collective 
efforts, objects of immediate utility. In this way the Bauhaus, 
willy-nilly, had already adopted the values of a society from which it 
had originally intended to be markedly set apart, so that the Bauhaus no
 longer maintained any essential separateness from society, other than 
differences of style and pedagogical approach. The neutralization of art
 within the Bauhaus, the emphatically greater value placed on design- 
and production-oriented work, and the acceptance of profit as 
motivation, all combined to make the Bauhaus conform to the scale of 
values prevalent in society at large. The school could not remain 
independent - not even intellectually - of a society on which it 
depended for moral and material support for its very existence.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">3</span>And yet this same 
society still expelled the Bauhaus, as a consequence of transformations 
that manifested as historical and political events. These would form a 
dark backdrop to the veritable cascade of liberated Ideas that poured 
forth during this fertile, creative period at the Bauhaus.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">4</span>The survival of 
the Bauhaus in Weimar was vouchsafed by a Social Democratic government 
that acted as a powerful counterbalance to the passions stirred up by 
various right-wing and nationalist groups. As long as the Social 
Democrats were in power, every investigation of anti-Bauhaus complaints 
concluded without impeachment of the school, and all proposals for 
cutting off funding were answered by a counter-proposal. However, in 
1923 there began a chain of political events that eventually resulted in
 the ouster of the Social Democratic government of Thuringia.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">5</span>Germany had 
defaulted in its payment of reparations, while France emphatically 
demanded the payments that were due. Since Germany was not making any 
cash payments - although, as the French pointed out, it had significant 
cash resources abroad - and delivered only a small fraction of the 
reparations in goods, on 11 January 1923, French and Belgian troops 
occupied the Ruhr region, in order to obtain at least the metallurgical 
brown coal mined there. The Germans responded with outrage and passive 
resistance, as well as acts of sabotage. German patriotic feelings 
surged over into the most extreme forms of nationalism; to make matters 
worse, the military occupation claimed its death toll, creating martyrs.
 Money rapidly lost its value - France charged that the inflation was 
fostered by artificial means, since the strength of the German economy 
could not have allowed such devaluation of the currency. The number of 
unemployed rose to over a million and a half,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn1" href="#ftn1">1</a>
 and provincial politics shifted to the extreme right or left. In 
Bavaria, extreme right-wing and nationalist passions peaked during 
Hitler's 'beer-hall' putsch in Munich on 8-9 November, while in Saxony 
and Thuringia the lawful elections held at the end of 1922 brought 
Communists into the governments along with the Socialists. This was 
unprecedented; Stalin announced that 'if events take a favourable turn, 
it is easily imaginable that the centre of gravity of the world 
revolutionary movement would shift from Soviet Russia to Germany.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn2" href="#ftn2">2</a>
 The government of the Reich did not wish to wait until this prediction 
came true, and the Bavarian military units were ordered to take up 
positions along the Saxon and Thuringian border zones, ready to attack 
at a moment's notice. Finally, on 21 October 1923, units of the 
Reichswehr occupied both territories. Armed workers offered resistance, 
but in the ensuing conflict the superior forces of the Reichswehr easily
 triumphed. However, there was a political catch to the situation: the 
army of the Reich was deployed against the legally elected local state 
governments. In this connection, the central government had to clarify 
its stand. Finally President Ebert resolved the crisis by 'referring to 
Paragraph 48 of the constitution, which empowers the president in 
especially critical situations to declare a state of emergency and 
thereby suspend a portion of democratic civil rights. The army was 
authorized to displace the legally elected governments of Thuringia and 
Saxony. There could hardly have been a more apt illustration of the 
paradoxical situation of the Weimar Republic: the first occasion when 
the president of the democratic republic resorted to the declaration of a
 state of emergency was the displacement of the constitutionally elected
 Social Democratic and Communist governments.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn3" href="#ftn3">3</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">6</span>The deployment 
of the Reichswehr troops signalled a shift to the right in Thuringia. 
The new elections, held in early 1924, gave a large majority of votes to
 the coalition of right-wing parties known as the Ordnungsbund. The 
Bauhaus and Gropius's private apartment were subjected to searches, as 
suspected 'hotbeds of communism'. Gropius, in his letter to General 
Hasse, protested against these outrageous and offensive actions, which 
cast the onus of politics on the Bauhaus, damaging its reputation in 
front of both the students and the public at large.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn4" href="#ftn4">4</a>
 When a coalition of the DVP and the DNVP (German People's Party and 
German National People's Party) formed a new government, the general 
opinion was that the Bauhaus would be summarily expelled from Weimar; 
this was the solution urged by Emil Herfurth, who had in the meantime 
become a Privy Councillor. But the government took care, at this early 
stage, not to become an accomplice of nationalist representatives, who 
had, in any case, long-term designs. Not wishing to form an alliance 
with these extreme elements, the government sought the support of 
moderate Socialists and cautious Democrats, who in turn supported the 
Bauhaus.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn5" href="#ftn5">5</a> 
However, this vacillation on the part of the government vis-à-vis the 
Bauhaus only fuelled the fires of the Bauhaus's enemies, who renewed 
their campaign against the school. One characteristic document of this 
effort was the so-called 'Yellow Brochure', putatively authored by the 
Weimar locksmith Arno Müller. But Gropius knew that the real authors 
were Hans Beyer, Josef Zachmann and Carl Schlemmer,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn6" href="#ftn6">6</a> who also borrowed from Vilmos Huszár's article in De <em>Stijl. </em>Gropius
 appealed to the international public, but the stream of letters and 
declarations of solidarity from home and abroad remained ineffective, as
 were the efforts of the 'Friends of the Bauhaus', who included Marc 
Chagall, Peter Behrens, Albert Einstein, Gerhart Hauptmann, Arnold 
Schönberg, Franz Werfel, Igor Stravinsky, Hans Poelzig, Oskar Kokoschka,
 Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Sommerfeld. Piet Mondrian and Theo van 
Doesburg wrote letters expressing their concern for the fate of the 
Bauhaus.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn7" href="#ftn7">7</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">7</span>Gropius's 
extraordinary public relations efforts and the mobilization of a 
considerable number of significant personages on the European 
intellectual scene could not alter the fact that the Bauhaus had become 
so entangled in the cogwheels of party politics that the decisions made 
about it were reliable indicators of the balance of power. The 
right-wing parliamentary majority whittled the Bauhaus budget down to 
one half and agreed to extend the masters' contracts only for six 
months. Under these circumstances work and planning for the future 
became impossible. On 26 December 1924, three days after the 
parliamentary decision, Walter Gropius, Lyonel Feininger, Wassily 
Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Gerhard Marcks, Adolf Meyer, László Moholy-Nagy, 
Georg Muche and Oskar Schlemmer announced in an open letter the closing 
of the Bauhaus in Weimar, effective as of 1 April 1925. Gropius's last, 
belated life-saving idea was to convert the Bauhaus workshops into a 
production company that would sell its products, or their designs, to 
industry, enabling the school to earn its way. This logical and 
realistic Idea was bound to lead to an upswing, in a German economy that
 was being re-invigorated by American capital introduced through the 
Dawes Plan. The state would have had to subsidize only the costs of the 
school building and the salaries of the small faculty. But a number of 
masters protested against this plan, saying that the Bauhaus was 
primarily an educational establishment, and as a production company it 
would not be able to fulfil this function. And indeed, what would have 
been the fate of the non-productive workshops? What would have become of
 Schlemmer's stage workshop, Kandlnsky's mural workshop, Klee's 
glass-painting workshop?<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn8" href="#ftn8">8</a>
 Even if the rest of the workshops had been able to support these, their
 fate at the Bauhaus would have been sealed. As the prevailing mood 
before the 1923 exhibition amply demonstrated, there were many - and 
especially among the members of the 'productive' workshops - who would 
much rather have laid claim to the artists' salaries, much less offer to
 support them. It is quite another question whether, given a new 
situation, and the survival of the Bauhaus in its entirety, a more 
favourable financial picture could have eradicated these internal 
conflicts of interest.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">8</span>Actually the 1923 
exhibition realized the hopes it had engendered: the Bauhaus received 
industrial orders, and these could have generated sufficient revenues to
 redeem Its financial and intellectual Independence. However, inflation 
swept away these funds. If, as some historians would have it, this 
inflation was indeed the result of a political manoeuvre, a 'false 
bankruptcy' created to decrease the value of payable reparations, then 
at this point In the Bauhaus's history we have an unusually clear 
Illustration of the direct dependence of the institution and the ideals 
It embodied upon the overall political picture in Germany. Again we are 
made to see that it was not only the Weimar interest groups that shaped 
the fate of the Bauhaus, but forces working far beyond, moving these 
groups themselves. The defeat of the Saxon and Thuringlan left by forces
 deployed by the central government emphatically and unmistakably 
demonstrated that in Germany there was no leftist alternative, and that 
the democratic constitution had offered no guarantee at all for any 
ideology or activity that significantly differed from the right-wing and
 conservative positions. The Bauhaus members and Gropius himself could 
not have been prepared for this. From the outset, they had considered 
their opponents to be only the provincial, local bureaucrats and 
academic artists, against whom they could seek the support of the 
central government and international opinion. The possibility that all 
of Germany would eventually be ruled by the likes of Emil Herfurth did 
not even occur to them; it would have seemed an absurdity.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">9</span>Between 1919 and 
1923 Gropius had come to accept the necessity of meeting the conditions 
set by society. By making compromises he still hoped to realize the 
intellectual and artistic strivings of the Bauhaus. But all this time he
 had been thinking along the rules of fair play and the invincibility of
 rationalist values; in other words, he believed in the firmness and 
permanence of the status quo proclaimed by the Weimar constitution. By 
reattuning itself to industrial design the Bauhaus went more than 
halfway towards meeting society's needs and now considered the 
high-quality fulfilment of these needs to be its goal. Thus the school 
showed its willingness to integrate itself into society, in exchange for
 freedom of thought and creative work. This attitude was circumspect and
 rational, for the society that Gropius was thinking of - the republic 
based on the Weimar constitution - could not but gladly accept the 
endeavours of the Bauhaus on the behalf of the community, including 
innovative experimentation.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">10</span>But Germany in 1924 was no longer what the Bauhaus members had believed it to be.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">11</span>Meanwhile, 
production in the workshops was on an upswing. Josef Hartwig's chess set
 was created around this time, each basically square piece carrying a 
formal element related to its movement; also the table lamp designed by 
Wilhelm Wagenfeld and Karl Jucker, which is still being produced. 
Numerous other successful furniture, textile and metal designs date from
 this period. More and more students matured into creative 
individualities; the first generation of graduates was apparently 
justifying Gropius's practice of dual workshop leadership. Josef Albers,
 Gunta Stölzl, Marcel Breuer, Herbert Bayer, Joost Schmidt, Otto Lindig,
 Farkas Molnár, Hinnerk Scheper, all possessed highly schooled yet 
original formal abilities as well as the necessary professional and 
technical skills. As Walter Scheidig aptly observes, perhaps the issue 
was no longer a matter of the unify of art and technology, but of craft 
and technology. Indeed, art in the strict sense of the word no longer 
seemed to fit into the new framework: 'These days Gropius is wishing his
 painters would just go to the devil', wrote Schlemmer.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn9" href="#ftn9">9</a>
 At the same time, the works of Albers, Stölzl and Breuer show an 
unmistakably intuitive sense of formal design, while their rational, 
functional forms emanate a characteristic surcharge of aesthetic 
qualify. To be sure, while objects designed at the Bauhaus were steeped 
in artistic formal qualities, all the same, painting, sculpture and 
subjective modes of expression In general were left out of any Immediate
 contact with the activities that constituted the daily life of the 
school. In March 1924, Schlemmer noted in his diary: 'The declaration 
referred frequently to the artist, a term and a type which are actually 
taboo at the Bauhaus. Well, how about the artist? According to Molnár he
 is merely an intelligent housepainter executing the commands of "higher
 necessity".'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn10" href="#ftn10">10</a> Schlemmer believed that 'the ways will part':<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn11" href="#ftn11">11</a>
 the architectonic-constructive tendencies of the new art would resolve 
into the immediately useful design of utilitarian objects, while 
'absolute art' and 'pure form' would continue to deal with the most 
Important aspect, the human element.</p>

 original ideal of 1919, had not been realized and was, in fact, 
unrealizable. Whereas Gropius, submerged as he was in the stream of 
ongoing changes, in keeping up with daily contingencies, in spite of all
 the readjustments, still persisted in the unbroken and consistent 
experience of what he called the 'Bauhaus idea', Schlemmer gave a 
precise and frank appraisal of the situation in his diary entry of 12 
November 1924: 'Perhaps the ultimate wisdom is: compromise. Developments
 in Germany and in art are being cut off before their prime. They are 
falling victim to the tempo of the times. I feel absolute freedom and 
metaphysical fulfilment have not yet been attained; the degree of formal
 perfection or of classic form necessary to the development of grand 
style has not been reached.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn12" href="#ftn12">12</a></p>

 At the same time, in Dessau, a town similar in size to Weimar and with 
similar local attitudes, the Bauhaus had its share of opponents who 
resented it either because of the school's leftist reputation or because
 of local craft interests. But whereas in Weimar the school had been a 
state institution, in Dessau it came under town jurisdiction. Here the

 it was conceivable in 1925. Gropius presented the Dessau municipal 
council with a proposal for an architectural complex consisting of a 
workshop building, a school building and a dormitory with studio 
apartments for 28 students. Rather unexpectedly, the entire project was 
approved. Construction was begun in September 1925.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn19" href="#ftn19">19</a>
 One wing of the brick- and glass-covered, reinforced concrete structure
 consisted of workshops and classrooms. At the level of the second and 
third floors a bridge supported by four pillars joined this to the other
 wing, which housed office space, faculty rooms, and additional 
classrooms for the Dessau Polytechnic Institute. Offices took up the 
lower level of the bridge; the upper level was reserved for the future 
architecture department and for Gropius's private office. There was an 
exhibition area in the workshop wing, and on the ground floor, near the 
entrance, a large lecture hall, theatre and cafeteria were clustered so 
that the three could be combined into one large space. Through this area
 one approached the six-storey dormitory building, the basement of which
 included a gymnasium and shower rooms. 'Thus, the Bauhaus, like a small
 world, contained within itself all spheres of life: living, eating, 
working, learning, entertainment, sports, and recreation. This 
combination of activities typified the famous community spirit, parties,
 and events of the Bauhaus,' writes Winfried Nerdinger.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn20" href="#ftn20">20</a></p>

underlying structural elements, the wall of glass surrounding the 
workshop wing ('in Dessau the Bauhaus was known as "the Aquarium'")<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn22" href="#ftn22">22</a>
 and the likewise largely glass-covered bridge realize a confident union

Frank Lloyd Wright called it in 1901, is one of the most prominent 
characteristics of the new style.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn23" href="#ftn23">23</a>
 According to Nerdinger, 'Especially the glass wall in the workshop wing
 illustrated Gropius's old desire to create a point of crystallization 
for the new era. It is much more than just a "transparent" plane ... The
 glass body Is the last symbol of the expressionist reform movement and 
as such is not to be judged from a functional point of view (with its 
orientation to the west, the glass heated up in summer and the workshops
 could not be kept warm in winter).'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn24" href="#ftn24">24</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">18</span>Indeed, ever since the proclamation of the ideal <em>Gesamtkunstwerk </em>('the
 crystallized symbol of a new faith'), this was the first chance Gropius
 had for epitomizing his concept of the timely and modern in an 
architectural opus. He was given the opportunity to create an integral 
work of art that was suitable for the complex functions of the Bauhaus 
and also served as the equivalent of a manifesto. As a material glass 
was the most concentrated and radiant symbol of the new spirit in 
architecture. The glass wall created a blurring of the boundary between 
'inside' and 'outside', and its lightness and ethereal nature added a 
triumphant note to the slender reinforced concrete supporting structure.
 These properties of glass contributed the emotive surplus that was so 
important for Gropius. By injecting functionalism into the 
representative, highly expressive architectural Ideals of the former 
Glass Chain, Gropius offered proof positive that here, indeed, was a new
 unity.</p>

1925, parallel to the construction of the Bauhaus building, construction
 was begun of the three pairs of semi-detached masters' residences: 
flat-roofed homes, complete with studios, for Kandinsky, Klee, 
Moholy-Nagy, Feininger, Schlemmer and Muche, and a free-standing house 
for Gropius. These houses were ready to be occupied in August 1926. The 
interior fixtures and furnishings were products of the Bauhaus 
workshops, and the interior walls were painted by the residents 
themselves. 'As the Bauhaus building was to be the architectural 
manifestation of the Bauhaus idea, the master houses served as 
demonstrations of a modern life and living style,'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn25" href="#ftn25">25</a>
 writes Nerdinger. The built-in wardrobes, the storage closets opening 
at both ends and the stately proportions all illustrated the 
Bauhaus-evolved notions of a normative home lifestyle. These houses, 
with their pleasantly articulated masses derived from prismatic shapes, 
are generally thought to be Gropius's most successful residential 
designs. Although the white walls and the windows and doors interrupting
 them did not present the two-dimensional, painting-like image of De 
Stijl buildings, these houses possess another kind of harmony. 
(Gropius's house and the building next to it were destroyed during the 
war; the others were renovated, but are structurally impaired.)</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">23</span>The new 
typography, as elaborated by Herbert Bayer, was conceived in the same 
spirit: simplified, rounded off - a type of grotesque or sans serif - 
consisting of lower case letters only. It gave a unified look to every 
Bauhaus publication, exhibition flyer, piece of stationery, and had 
perhaps the greatest single role in defining the characteristic visual 
profile of the Bauhaus.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn29" href="#ftn29">29</a>
 The omission of capital letters, even at the cost of violating German 
orthography, had deep roots in the modernism of the age. Similarly, the 
passionate, emotional ring of <em>Ziel </em>'(destination', 'goal') was replaced by the more modest and direct Zweck ('aim', 'design'); instead of <em>Theater, Bühne </em>('stage') was preferred, and the rejection of <em>Kunst </em>('art') in favour of <em>Gestaltung </em>('design',
 'form-creation') all signalled a shift in outlook regarding the entire 
field of fine arts and applied art. The most significant indication of 
this was the altered use of the word for architecture, perhaps the 
clearest equivalent of the shift to lower case letters. Instead of the 
implicitly capitalized ring and self-importance of <em>Architektur, </em>the
 modest and practical Bauen ('build', 'construct') came to be used. 
Siegfried Giedion wrote about the Werkbund exhibition of 1928, 'Neues 
Bauen' ('New Architecture'): 'Why is this exhibition entitled "Neues 
Bauen", and why not simply "Neue Architektur"? We are not intimidated by
 the word Architektur, but it has a delimited meaning that is no longer 
valid today. The concept of architecture evokes the usual … large-scale 
stone buildings, while today's materials, steel and reinforced concrete,
 condense the actual supporting structure of the building into a slim 
skeleton. This necessarily leads to formal solutions different from that
 of stone … Architecture is the last to enter the process of 
industrialization. The transfer from handicrafts to industrial 
production, from individual to collective creation, has been going on 
with compelling force for some centuries. This means that the same 
arguments that were used against mechanized looms, railroads and sewing 
machines are now being used against architecture.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn30" href="#ftn30">30</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">24</span>Now that typography, the design of objects and the building itself imbued the Bauhaus with a unified <em>outlook </em>- even if it was not yet a unified <em>style </em>- the school indeed came very close to the idea of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk </em>in
 its original, 1919 sense. For what was emerging was precisely the 
approach and the closely related set of design ideas that could point 
the way to a new style. The change in outlook that came about at this 
time had been formulated even before Giedion by Kállai in 1924, 
following the dissolution of the various Constructivist Utopias (when 
Lajos Kassák issued his terse slogan, 'Back to the workbenchl'):<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn31" href="#ftn31">31</a>
 'And where there is no cult developed around ideological abstractions,

 Kállai had outspokenly stated what Gropius never said in so many words.
 While Gropius spoke about the continuity of the Bauhaus programme and 
Bauhaus concept, Kdllai called this transformation by its proper name: 
'The new architecture ... should not purport to be more than 
unostentatious clothing or shelter. Nor should it try for the role of <em>Stadtkrone</em><a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn33" href="#ftn33">33</a>
 ['crown of the city'] ... and be a gawky idol, squatting on the horizon
 in the manner of pyramids and domes ... It is sad enough that the 
monumentality of factory smokestacks, blast furnaces and tenements 
oppresses our daily life. Therefore let us not wish for additional stone
 monsters, adulatory ideological monoliths, to tower over us.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn34" href="#ftn34">34</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">25</span>No matter how 
significant the divergences in the work of the Bauhaus artists and 
designers may be, in one vital respect a collective creation did come 
about at the Bauhaus. It became clearly obvious by the 1923-4 school 
year, not only in the projects done in the Preliminary Course, but in 
the objects created in the workshops as well, that everything had to be 
rethought, starting with the basics, the elementary forms and qualities 
-and in this the students received invaluable help from Klee and 
Kandinsky, of all people. Klee's 'Theory of Form' course, and 
Kandinsky's course, 'Form and Colour Studies', both analysed the 
properties of the basic units of composition, the elementary forms and 
colours. No matter how far these two men had retreated from the school's
 new, industrial orientation and technocentric outlook, nonetheless they
 introduced an entire generation of students to the neutral fundamental 
principles of pictorial composition, rethinking with them the meanings 
of point, line, plane, movement -the most elementary and minimal visual 
gestures.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">26</span>This kind of 
reductionism, such restriction of formal and expressive means to the 
basics was the equivalent of taking a step back before leaping forward. 
In order to develop a new world of form, one had to return to the 
neutral basics not only to circumvent the existing formal order, but 
also to realize the more far-reaching task of reattuning the 
sensibility. This of course would not have been possible If there had 
not been a call for it 'in the air', for lack of a better term. After 
the by now familiar barrage of expressionist orgies in colour and form 
that stretched pictorial dynamics and histrionics to the limits, the new
 sensibility had to be returned to a resting point, a formal and emotive
 ground zero, where it could begin anew to register the weight and 
importance of minimal stimuli. The scale had to be altered. Here was a 
call for sober economy of means, after the prodigal outpouring of 
expressive energies. The basic unit of the new pictorial and formal 
expression - the new aesthetics -became the meaning inherent in the 
smallest increments in value differences, the slightest shifts. By 
making artist and viewer again receptive to minimal stimuli, the 
foundations of a new formal language were laid down.</p>

appointed young masters had an outstanding role in this process. For 
them, it would have been strange and inconceivable to make a vow such as
 Muche's when he, a painter, had been appointed to head the textile 
workshop: 'I promised myself that never in my life would I let my hands 
prepare a textile design'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn35" href="#ftn35">35</a>
 The new masters were far more open-minded and multifaceted than this. 
In fact they were equally at home in handling practical workshop 
problems, dealing with materials and composing works of art. Marcel 
Breuer abandoned a career as a painter for the sake of furniture design,
 and then switched to architecture, while continuing to work in the 
theatre. Gunta Stölzl's textiles were in many instances works of visual 
art. Joost Schmidt's sculptures were expressive by themselves, as well 
as functional as architectural elements. In addition, while chiefly a 
sculptor, he also excelled in applied graphics. These young masters were
 far less restricted by specialization, far less limited in scope, than 
their crafts masters had been. In addition, what they learned from their
 artist masters was not merely a mode of work directed towards the 
creation of the autonomous work of art, but the basic elements of 
composition.</p>

 shapes of materials that were cut out also had to be used, if possible

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">32</span>In Dessau - especially after the erection of the Bauhaus building - the ideal of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk </em>shifted from architecture, which unites the arts and crafts, to the <em>human being. </em>It
 was no longer an object, but an ideal human being, that was expected to
 be the realization of wholeness as a utopianistic objective. Although 
there arose some absolutely Utopian architectural designs - Gropius's 
plan for a 'Total Theatre', Andor Weininger's drawing of a 'Spherical 
Theatre', and Farkas Molnár's 'U-Theatre',<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn41" href="#ftn41">41</a>
 all of them analogies of the universe - still, Gropius, Schlemmer, 
Moholy-Nagy and many others at the Bauhaus thought in terms of an ideal 
far beyond practical tasks, which they called the <em>whole man. </em>In
 their thought-experiments they attempted to resolve the contradictions 
between an immediate, sensory experience of life and the hazy figure of 
the 'perfect technician' at the control panel of a future automated 
worid-machine. The microcosm of the stage was the most suitable 
experimental field for these Utopias, since the mechanically controlled 
stage machinery and the spherical design of these utopianistic theatres 
presented with striking three-dimensionality the form and fate of the 
coming human who would live a new kind of life in the cosmos. 'A 
specialized education becomes meaningful only if an integrated man is 
developed in terms of his biological functions, so that he will achieve a
 natural balance of intellectual and emotional power. Without such an 
aim the richest differentiations of specialized study ... are mere 
quantitative acquisitions, bringing no intensification of life, no 
widening of its breadth … these are the foundations for developing a 
mastery of all of life, for finding one's proper place within the 
community.' So writes Moholy-Nagy under the heading 'The future needs 
the whole man'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn42" href="#ftn42">42</a>
 But this 'proper place within the community' demanded or presupposed 
the performance of a specialist function and a 'specialized training'. 
If humans were to be emancipated from such limitations, in exchange for 
the intellectual ability to oversee a whole universe they would have to 
give up the sphere of first-hand experience, life's sensory dimensions. 
Whereas Gropius and Moholy-Nagy had intended to save for future 
generations a certain characteristic of the craftsman, the ability to 
oversee the entire creative process and the opportunity of freely 
changing it - as opposed to the Industrial worker who Is condemned to 
execute a mechanical, partial function that hinders personal 
development. What is more, the craftsman is also able to follow the path
 of his product in society. The whole man, the new human type of the 
future, would only be able to compete with his craftsman forerunner by 
altering the relationship of man and machine: by acting only in the 
capacity of designer. Instead of adjusting his labour to the 
requirements and possibilities of machines that are primarily geared to 
produce in maximal quantities, the new man, on the basis of altered 
needs, would prescribe to the machine what and how it should produce. 
The new aim was 'evolving goods and buildings specifically designed for 
industrial production'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn43" href="#ftn43">43</a></p>

      </ul>
      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">33</span>At the same 
time it meant recognizing that 'the machine is... an instrument which is
 to relieve man of the most oppressive physical labour and serve to 
strengthen his hand so as to enable him to give form to his creative 
impulse … The work of the new man will become an organic part of unified
 industrial production ... for creative freedom does not reside in the 
infinitude of means of expression, but in free movement within Its 
strictly legal bounds'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn44" href="#ftn44">44</a>
 Therefore the worker must turn into an engineer; and here, according to
 Gropius's ideas, we are dealing with a transformation of handicrafts 
and art that would meld the creative intellectual and manual work into a
 single design process. Design means the formal and structural shaping 
of the product along the lines of its function, as well as the 
specification of its production technology. Thus the designer must be 
familiar with the consumers' needs in order to know <em>what </em>has to
 be designed; and with the means of production, the machines, in order 
to know the technological limitations within which the object has to be 
conceived. This way man is freed of actual physical labour, or at least 
such labour would not have to follow the pace and rhythms of machine 
production. Nonetheless, a considerable price must still be paid: the 
work of the human intellect and imagination - design - must be routinely
 adjusted to the machine. But this idea should not be read as a 
restriction of unlimited human intellectual capacities to fit the bounds
 of technology, a voluntary decision to stay 'within limits set by 
stringent laws'. On the contrary: it should be taken as a celebration of
 the endless possibilities of a technology that would provide wings for 
human imagination and creativity. The new ideal is the human being 
capable of maximal enjoyment of the new potentials - 'the perfect 
engineer of the world'. And, in order to preserve at least some memories
 of the organic, material world, Moholy-Nagy decided to continue to 
teach tactile exercises and the study of materials in his Preliminary 
Course.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">34</span>The first, 
Gropius-directed years of the Dessau Bauhaus saw stage works that were 
exclusively mechanical variety shows, plays of audio-visual form. These 
were the mechanized colour/form compositions of Andor Weininger and 
Heinz Loew, evoking a world in which, according to Ernó' Kállai, 'human 
fates would be coordinated as traffic patterns are on the tracks of an 
electric toy train: without accidents and catastrophes.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn45" href="#ftn45">45</a> But Kállai immediately appends the critique of such Utopias: 'But a/so <em>without community. </em>Because
 in a community of humans where entire networks of interpersonal 
relations, with all their mutual interdependences or autonomies, are 
laid open in a predetermined constellation, there cannot be shared fates
 - for lack of fatality - and beyond this, there cannot be emotional 
ties, shared feelings. Humans, whose consciousness, its entire form and 
content untouched by unconscious impulses, lies exposed perfectly 
visible for themselves and for others, cannot experience true union, 
beyond practical alliances and transient associations. Their relations, 
lacking any tragic potential, and without a past, cannot help but remain
 mechanical and superficial.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn46" href="#ftn46">46</a>
 Schlemmer himself expressed similar ideas in 1927, as he drew his 
conclusions from the mechanical stage: 'Since we do not have a perfected
 mechanical stage ... man remains perforce our essential element. And of
 course he will remain so as long as the stage exists. In 
contradistinction to the rationalistically determined world of space, 
form, and colour, man is the vessel of the subconscious, the unmediated 
experience, and the transcendental.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn47" href="#ftn47">47</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">35</span>In the end it was
 this unavoidable fact that shipwrecked these Utopias; it was the 
acknowledgment or neglect of these dimensions that was the true 
watershed between the so-called artistic sphere of the Bauhaus and the 
design sphere. Klee, Kandinsky and Schlemmer were unable to find a 
common language, or more accurately, an actual intellectual platform and
 work programme to share with Moholy-Nagy and Gropius, whose work and 
interpretation of the Bauhaus's goals focused on the more outward, 
social-oriented and definable activities. Of course the questions 
remain: to what extent can an educational institution be permeated by 
philosophy? And is artistic radicalism compatible with social radicalism
 that is, in comparison, so much tamer, and much more of a public 
property?</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">36</span>Gropius himself
 desired to resolve the dilemma of part versus whole in the field of 
architecture, in an original conclusion drawn from the relation of human
 and machine. He posited a characteristically Groplus-like equilibrium, 
in a speech delivered In 1927: 'Individual freedom can be guaranteed if 
only certain parts are standardized, whereas the rest of the building Is
 shaped according to personal requirements.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn48" href="#ftn48">48</a>
 This proposal, although not the cheapest way of constructing dwellings,
 would have been easily realizable. But if this formula had indeed 
guaranteed that soothing equilibrium, satisfactory to all parties, 
between the opposed poles of part and whole, individual and collective, 
individuum and society, then there would have been no need for the 
existence of the Bauhaus.</p>

  Nerdinger, op. cit., p. 70: 'The planning process is interesting in 
more than one respect: Since Adolf Meyer, head of Gropius's office, had 
not moved to Dessau, Gropius asked his old co-worker Carl Fieger to work
 on the design. Later, Mrs Fieger made some general comments about the 
collaboration: "her husband... made some sketches which Gropius then 
changed and used to explain his Ideas." it is unclear whether it was 
Reger or Ernst Neufert, Meyer's successor as head of the office, who 
continued working on the project. In any case, Gropius, who practically 
never drew himself, succeeded on the basis of his verbal abilities, 
without Meyer, in creating an excellent design... Because Gropius wanted
 to make the new Bauhaus building a showpiece and working model of his 
theory of art and architecture, it is safe to assume that in this case 
he was most especially Involved in the design.'</p>
