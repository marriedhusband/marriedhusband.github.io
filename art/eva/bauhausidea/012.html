      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">1</span>THE unfavourable
 responses to the exhibitions of 1922, and their hostile reception in 
Weimar, again strained the by now almost peaceful relations between the 
Bauhaus and the town. The upkeep of the school, because of financial and
 political considerations, continued to depend on legislative decisions,
 and there were many who were eager to influence these. Dr Beyer, the 
legal counsellor and financial director, second in command at the 
Bauhaus, Carl Schlemmer (Oskar Schlemmer's brother, and craft master of 
the wall-painting workshop), and Josef Zachmann, the craft master of the
 cabinet-making shop and Gropius's close associate, began a campaign of 
rumours and accusations regarding Gropius's private life and the 
practices of his architectural office. Meanwhile Dr Beyer negotiated 
with the government about hiring a new bookkeeper, without consulting 
Gropius. Gropius took the entire affair, including all the charges made 
against him, to be aired in front of the Bauhaus Masters' Council, 
inviting all the crafts masters and even Gertrud Grunow to the meeting, 
where he requested the appointment of an independent committee to 
investigate the charges. This took place on 5 October 1922; on the 
evening of 14 October the members of the investigating committee - 
Kandinsky, Muche, Josef Hartwig and Emil Lange -were able to report that
 they had found every single one of the charges unfounded. On 20 
October, after Carl Schlemmer and Zachmann had taken the whole affair to
 the Ministry, the events were entered into the record. On 11 December 
1922 the meeting of the Masters' Council was able to put an end to the 
affair: since the charges had proved to be entirely unfounded, Dr Beyer,
 Carl Schlemmer and Zachmann were asked to leave the Bauhaus 
immediately.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn1" href="#ftn1">1</a> 
Zachmann and Schlemmer withdrew their charges, having admitted their 
groundlessness, but Dr Beyer, who maintained close contact with 
nationalist circles in Weimar, was not allowed by these to withdraw his 
charges.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn2" href="#ftn2">2</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">2</span>Gropius wrote in

confused and nervous, but I still like him, even though he does not make
 my life any easier.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn3" href="#ftn3">3</a>
 Gropius had to decide if he should part with Oskar Schlemmer as well. 
He even asked a friend in Stuttgart, Lily Hildebrandt, to suggest a 
replacement; her choice was Willi Baumeister. But Gropius was 
large-minded enough to think in terms of the whole picture, and did not 
let his momentary personal sensitivities influence his decision. He 
remained loyal to Schlemmer: 'Just wait and see, once Schlemmer starts 
to work again, he will leave Baumeister far behind. The latter, in spite
 of his fine gestures, and no matter how attractive his character, still
 creates "at second hand".'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn4" href="#ftn4">4</a>
 Gropius had not in the least changed his position since early 1919,

was the single most important determinant in the fate of the Bauhaus.</p>

generation of students was nearing the end of their studies, the time 
for providing the opportunity of architectural Instruction for them was 
on hand. After a thorough search, and in good part on the basis of Klee

        <p class="citation">Dear Mr Lange,<br>… After the first two and a
 half years of our existence, we have reached the point at which we can 
set out in the direction of practical work by training our students and 
journeymen in architectural practice. Towards this end we intend to 
establish a large-scale experimental studio where practical workshop 
problems may be addressed in both the technical and the formal senses, 
under the direction of a highly qualified practising architect.<br>Such 
an experimental studio would stay in contact with the architectural 
commissions received by the Bauhaus or by myself. We are within reach of
 the practical possibility of receiving a commission for the 
construction of a housing project.<br>The direction of such an 
experimental studio should be entrusted only to someone with practical 
experience, who knows contemporary forms and technologies, is 
technically inventive, and beyond all this, possesses the necessary 
practical abilities.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn5" href="#ftn5">5</a></p>

 and would have also proved to be of key importance to a possible

postponed problems. Lange's finely tuned ear caught the repeated 
emphasis on the word 'practical', and he wanted to clarify his position 
and work sphere, before accepting the appointment:</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="citation">Since our personal discussion I have come to
 feel that the appointment you offer would claim only a partial use of 
my creative powers, leading to a one-sided, and for me unpleasant, 
exploitation of my abilities... from your letter I can see that you draw
 a distinction between the artist form masters and myself. This makes it
 clear that in the field of architecture (and I mean architecture in the
 sense of your Bauhaus programme) you also draw a strict line between 
formal and practical components. I myself, just like your Bauhaus 
programme, do not recognize such distinctions<br>A possible explanation 
might be that you believe this separation of functions to be the result 
of the latest developments, insofar as the kinds of people needed by you
 are found as two special types. This would mean that you would consider
 each type unqualified in the area of the other, and with each given 
task you intend to draw sharp lines of demarcation between them. All of 
this may have a bearing in the case of the visual artists, who are 
unsure in practical matters of crafts, while the craftsmen are too 
rigid.<br>But in the field of architecture this would lead to an 
entirely deplorable situation. If you classify me exclusively among the 
practical builders, I shall make no objections, in the spirit of your 
Bauhaus. However, insofar as this classification refers to an appraisal 
of my abilities, unless I am much mistaken, I must insist on a 
correction. It has never been my ambition to be known as a construction 
specialist. Nor do I acknowledge a dividing line between the structural 
and the formal, as no such thing has ever existed in the great periods 
of architecture, and there is no such thing in the deepest sense of 
architecture. It is impossible for someone to be a fine architect in the
 technical sense of the word, without at the same time being talented in
 the spirit of architectural form. It is equally Inconceivable for me 
that one can be a good architect without at least some feeling for 
structural solutions.<br>These considerations have determined my 
development over the course of years. At the outset, I. too, had wanted 
to be an architect in the old sense of the word, motivated by my love of
 form. However, I soon came to differ with such architects because of 
their one-sidedness. Therefore I turned in a purely practical direction,
 in order to learn the practical foundations of all types of 
architecture, and to avoid bias of any kind. And now you would have me 
engage in a one-sided activity of the opposite kind; acceptance of this 
would mean conflict with the entire curriculum for me.<br>If I were to 
respect this strict dividing line, then, for example, it would be 
impossible for me to convey to the students my observations on 
architectural construction without being free to refer to the 
significance of each and every component of the building from a formal 
point of view - whereas only by this means can one arouse the interest 
of the students, and achieve their understanding of technical problems. 
In my opinion, we cannot make such distinctions if we want to realize 
the programme of the Bauhaus. I am aware that you have divided the 
masters into two groups, form masters and crafts masters. However, I do 
not think that a practising architect such as myself can be wholly 
assigned to one or the other of these groups.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn7" href="#ftn7">7</a></p>

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">5</span>Gropius received these remarks from the most sensitive quarter: from an <em>architect </em>An architect, moreover, who most probably did his own drawings.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">6</span>It was precisely 
as an architect - the representative of the supreme synthesis of all art
 - that Gropius evolved the notion of training the new type of 
architect/technician who receives instruction in art and technical 
expertise from the most authentic sources. It was precisely in the role 
of architect that he came to distinguish between these aspects, so that 
he could reunite them by means of a new kind of chemical reaction. And 
now, in the person of Lange It was an architect, of all people, who 
protested, and refused to acknowledge the separability of artistic and 
technical aspects.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">7</span>Nonetheless, it was with the utmost confidence that Gropius replied to Lange:</p>

        <p class="citation">I believe I shall be able to set your mind 
entirely at rest, and in the following I am going to employ the same 
openness that characterized your letter.<br>In our discussion I said to 
you that in my opinion, under the present circumstances, we cannot find 
individuals who, like the masters of times past, are equally competent 
in craft and are powerful artists at the same time. I can hardly name 
any exceptions to this. Therefore I based the entire curriculum on a 
twofold system, founded on the duality of the form master and the craft 
master. But the more one group masters the material of the other, all 
the better; the cross-influences would not affect the affiliation of the
 individual masters with their own group, because they are judged on an 
equal footing, and this is reflected by the remuneration as well.<br>Returning
 to your situation: judging on the basis of your personality, and by the
 few works of yours that I have seen, my impression is that you are a 
most experienced builder, possessing highly developed senses of form and
 proportion - and this means a great deal. It would appear, however, 
that your works do not bring to the forefront any new formal problems 
that you solve in your own, recognizable formal language. Whether this 
might not change, here in our atmosphere, which is so permeated by 
formal concepts, remains to be seen. It would be a fine thing, and the 
right thing, in my opinion, if here everyone taught - both technique and
 form - in the measure that his accomplishment in the respective area 
entitles him. Then everything would regulate itself. No one will be 
hindered in his unfolding, neither by me nor by anyone else, because out
 of the work of individuals we intend to create a unity that may be 
grasped as a whole. I hope you understand this.<br>For yet another 
reason I have stressed technical competence in the process of fitting 
into our system. The experimental area that we are collectively 
endeavouring to establish aims to extend precisely this collective 
effort to reach the field of architecture. However, most of the form 
masters are lacking in the technical skills needed to transplant their 
formal ideas into the realm of actualization. What the outcome of such 
endeavours may be, we are unable to tell at this stage. We should be 
most grateful to accept any and all positive contributions you might 
make. You, along with me, stand in the centre of the Whole, and the 
success of our experiment will essentially hinge on our ability to 
cooperate. On my part, I very much look forward to working together with
 you.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn8" href="#ftn8">8</a></p>

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">8</span>It is remarkable 
that Gropius should speak of disparate formal and practical/technical 
problems regarding architecture, of all fields, when architecture is the
 very activity that from the outset intends to unite the otherwise 
separable artistic (formal) and technical spheres. The question offers 
itself: why didn't he look for an architect who had evolved his own 
formal language to accompany his own formal methods? Or else, why didn't
 Gropius himself take in his hands the direction of the planned 
architectural workshop? Instead, he mechanically carried over the 
division of art and technique into an area where this division should 
have ceased to exist - chiefly because the students had by now received 
their twofold training, and, at the start of their architectural 
studies, it was high time to realize the synthesis aimed at.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">9</span>At this time it 
was Gropius himself who was essentially responsible for separating the 
spheres of art and technique - the joining of which had originally 
formed the basis of his entire programme. He did this presumably because
 he was again obeying the dictates of the situation; he wanted to employ
 Lange to fill a predefined role, and had no need for another associate 
who would transgress the limits assigned to him within the structure of 
the Bauhaus, and thereby lay claim to a more comprehensive intellectual 
leadership. In this sense, the spirit of Itten continued to haunt the 
Bauhaus for a long time: Gropius most definitely strove to keep each 
master within the bounds of his sector in the total task.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">10</span>That the 
problem of such a division, or its possibility, had preoccupied the 
climate of opinion within the Bauhaus around this time is indicated by 
the fact that, less than a month after Gropius's letter to Lange, the 
Masters' Council considered the question: 'By what means can the student
 body be divided into creative talents as opposed to merely gifted 
craftsmen?'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn9" href="#ftn9">9</a> and 
so make the masters' task easier in the workshops. Although Gropius put 
off the answer until the next semester - when, as we know, the masters 
and students would have other matters to keep them busy - the mere 
emergence of this idea, just like Lange's reasoning, was an indisputable
 sign that although the distant goal may have been a new synthesis, the 
present saw only the separation and hermetic isolation of these 
different aspects. This constituted the practice. The rest, for the time
 being, remained theory.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">11</span>Naturally Gropius
 could by no means accept this kind of categorization of the students: 
for the ones classified as 'creative talents' would immediately drop all
 workshop activity and fall victim to the cult of artistic genius; 
meanwhile the internal value system of the Bauhaus would be skewed by 
the devaluation of the craft skills acquired in the workshops.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">12</span>Gropius, who in 
his heart had by now found his way back to his prewar ideals, faced an 
almost insoluble tangle of tasks. He wanted to present a truly new 
quality: a new kind of object created by a new kind of expert designer; 
he intended to bring this about under his own sovereign aegis as 
director, as independently as possible from outside forces; and in the 
interests of his twofold goal he had to maintain a certain facade, the 
image of an outstanding school, well-known for its faculty of 
internationally respected artists, without which he could not hope for 
support. Therefore the facade could not show the slightest sign of a 
rift; he had to employ the greatest caution and diplomacy regarding Klee
 and Kandinsky's activities and artistic and pedagogic theories, for, 
although their intellectual and artistic works were totally irrelevant 
from the point of view of Gropius's concrete endeavours, they were the 
supporting pillars of that facade without which not even the thought of a
 move towards industrial design (to call a spade a spade) could have 
arisen. At the same time the situation was further complicated by 
Gropius's most sincere respect for the two artists, and his deep-down 
conviction that their presence and influence had an undeniable if 
hard-to-pinpoint effect on the actual level and importance of the 
Bauhaus's work.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">13</span>Still, it must 
have been difficult to counter Kandinsky's declaration in the course of 
the debate about romantic-individualist versus objective-rationalist 
work methods: 'Individuality is the harbinger of the future, and the 
collective is a thing of the past.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn10" href="#ftn10">10</a>
 This was all the harder to swallow because in saying this, Kandinsky 
was not assuming Itten's role as Gropius's antipode within the inner 
power structure of the Bauhaus, but was referring to the catastrophe he 
had lived through in Russia, and which had come to mean, as early as 
1922, 'the loss of a whole generation'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn11" href="#ftn11">11</a>
 This experience, although no one would have guessed it at the time, lay
 in store for Germany as well; but in 1922 in avant-garde or progressive
 circles it would have been sacrilege to place individuality as a value 
above the collective. What Kandinsky, with his Moscow experiences behind
 him, meant by the term <em>collective, </em>was, at that time in Weimar, probably understood by no one else but him.</p>

Gropius desired to regulate by means of theories, Kandinsky would have

preparation as of their craft background', Kandinsky objected: 
'Admission should hinge on the selection of suitable human beings rather
 than on the choice of a method.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn12" href="#ftn12">12</a>
 Aware of how easily theory could degenerate into ideology, Kandinsky

limited methods.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">16</span>At all events, 
Kandinsky was one of the most respected personages at the Bauhaus. In 
his person, a living legend entered the Bauhaus; the mythic dimension 
surrounding him was greater than that of all the other masters put 
together. Organizer, founder and leader of the famous Munich group Neue 
Kunstlervereinigung ('New Association of Artists'), then of the even 
more famous Der Blaue Reiter; acknowledged as the creator of the first 
abstract painting; author of the essay so deeply influential for anyone 
committed to the cause of modern art, 'Concerning the Spiritual in Art' -
 and, on top of everything, a Russian, who played a leading role In the 
organization of a modern art institution, INKhUK (Institute of Artistic 
Culture), in Moscow. He held the rank of seniority at the Bauhaus - he 
was 56 years old - yet the students respected him above all perhaps 
because of his logic, his objectivity, his exact and clear reasoning. 
'With Klee, everything remained a bit up in the air; in the end it was 
up to you to make whatever you could of him. Kandinsky was extremely 
constructive,'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn13" href="#ftn13">13</a>
 recalls Gunta Stölzl, a student, and later leader of the textile 
workshop. Herbert Bayer emphasized that 'Kandinsky valued highly the 
individual gifts and personalities of his students. Although he could be
 extremely self-assured, he was always courteous ... A perfect 
gentleman, who never made you conscious of his superiority. His 
criticism was objective.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn14" href="#ftn14">14</a>
 According to Xanti Schawinsky 'Kandinsky, when discussing a problem 
with the students, was intensely attentive, in his own worldly style, 
smoking a cigarette, and his comments touched on areas that at first 
glance did not seem to relate to the problem on hand, but would soon 
prove to be valuable by unfolding the universal implications of the 
work. His critiques were almost festive experiences, treasure and 
enlightenment in one.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn15" href="#ftn15">15</a></p>

        <p class="citation">The instruction he offered to those of his 
students who worked as autonomous painters was providentially divided 
into two parts: on the one hand, theoretical instruction and, on the 
other, the analysis and correction of works created in the painting 
class. Here we had to explain what we had intended to achieve in our 
work, and what we felt to be the means to realize our aims. Holding a 
small writing slate In his hand, Klee sketched out In chalk what he 
thought should have been done to reach the stated aim, and, having 
discussed the matter with his small audience, wiped the slate clean, 
leaving It up to the student to draw his or her own conclusions.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn17" href="#ftn17">17</a></p>

        <p class="citation">only the methods could be taught; if the 
same applied to the thematic world, the student would be in immediate 
danger of being swallowed up by the teacher's personality. Klee tried to
 avoid this danger by never divulging any information about his own 
technical methods, and never giving guidance about how to achieve 
specific effects of one kind or another. All of that we had to find out 
for ourselves by experimentation. He gave assignments towards this end. 
For example: 'Try to express the processes of thinning out and 
condensing: the movements of various degrees of colourlessness on a 
coloured surface. Colour is absorbed, swallowed up - now colour turns 
into a death agony, decomposition, twilight, decay - a negative 
movement. Or else depict the movement of colour values on a colourless 
surface. The way colour triumphs, reigns enthroned, grows, becomes 
growth itself..." He periodically changed the themes of his lectures, 
always adjusting them to new circumstances. In the various courses the 
assignments sometimes duplicated each other - but the solutions were 
never rigidly Identical. At the conclusion of one of his courses he 
said: 'This is one possibility -1 myself, by the way, do not resort to 
it.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn18" href="#ftn18">18</a></p>

the affairs of the Bauhaus with the same unbiased mindset as he did 
every artistic and intellectual problem - perhaps this too earned him 
the nickname 'The Good Lord'. He observed everything but said little. He
 did not judge, nor did he typecast. Felix Klee, his son, describes one

the Beyer-Zachmann-Carl Schlemmer affair):</p>

at the figure-drawing studio of the Weimar Bauhaus. The agenda was the 
expulsion from the institute of a few crafts masters who turned out to 
be insufferable fellows. The Director, Walter Gropius, gave an 
incendiary speech about lawful and unlawful behaviour. Master Johannes 
Itten gave his interpretation of an Indian legend about a man who, 
bitten by a poisonous snake, began to run around in circles, to save his
 life by sweating out the poison. After masters and students were all 
done with their speeches and counter-speeches, suddenly Paul Klee rose 
to speak. Everyone grew silent. My father then proceeded, calm and 
collected, to read in his savoury Swiss German accents the text on the

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">20</span>Klee was the 
purest representative of the creative attitude that insists on the 
highest measure of self-sufficiency and independent development. This 
path is the most difficult, and is followed by the fewest students, 
young or old. Van Doesburg, in directing his attack at Itten, was in 
essence opposing the pedagogic method, leading to independence and 
autonomy, that Klee espoused. In fact, Itten and van Doesburg's 
educational ideas had more in common than Klee's had with theirs; after 
all, both of them offered ready-made philosophies of life that their 
students could passively adopt, while Klee refused to do for his 
students a task that they should have done themselves. This is what 
Feininger was reflecting on, when vacationing with Kandinsky early in 
the autumn of 1922: 'We were wondering how many (or rather how few) of 
the students are really conscious of what they want to achieve and 
strong enough to follow their course painstakingly. For most of them the
 unsentimental and perfectly unyielding van Doesburg seems to supply 
something definite, a dogma, something ready-made to cling to - contrary
 to our explorational endeavours, which in the long run would lead them 
much further. Why is there this voluntary submission to the tyranny of a
 van Doesburg, and this mulish noncompliance with all requests or even 
suggestions put forth by the Bauhaus?'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn20" href="#ftn20">20</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">21</span>This intellectual
 question was posed in Germany, in the autumn of the year that saw the 
assassination of the foreign minister Rathenau in the summer, the 
triumphant entry of Mussolini in Rome, and the inflation of the value of
 the dollar from 550 marks In July to 7500 marks in December.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">22</span>Therefore Klee, 
as one of the 'corridor masters' - those masters who rarely, if ever, 
showed themselves in the workshops - happened to represent precisely the
 most demanding and highest aspirations of the Bauhaus. In spite of not 
contributing in a concrete manner to the objects being made in the 
workshops, he was Inculcating in his students the highest standards of 
artistic and human autonomy that in effect coincided with what Gropius 
called the <em>Bauhaus idea, </em>and which was, from the very outset, 
and as Gropius had always intended, the opposite of every sort of 
narrow-minded dogmatism, such as that represented by van Doesburg in 
Weimar.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">23</span>But the De Stijl 
group also had a fertilizing effect on the Bauhaus, although not in the 
field of ideology. Marcel Breuer, one of the most talented students at 
the Bauhaus, after his <em>Africa chair of </em>the Expressionist Itten 
era, designed his famous armchair in 1922 under the influence of De 
Stijl designer Gerrit Rietveld. The tubular light fixtures of Gropius's 
office were also inspired by De Stijl. The exclusive use of clear 
colours and structures of elementary purity had, without a doubt, the 
effect of a manifesto; and by 1922 the Bauhaus was obviously more 
receptive to the integration of international Constructivist currents 
than to the continuation of earlier Expressionist tendencies. This style
 change, which had clearly taken place in spite of the fact that at the 
Bauhaus style was not to be a topic of discussion, brought the objects 
created at the Bauhaus closer to industrial design, because the 
international Constructivist trends that they had spontaneously begun to
 adopt pointed towards the clearest, leanest design lines - that is, the
 forms most conducive to mechanized mass production. In addition, the 
aesthetics of Constructivism had certain economic implications: the 
constructivist object embodied an idea - maximal stylistic and 
utilitarian value through minimal means, a notion that favoured 
industrial viewpoints.</p>

 and accompanying the style change was a 'change in tone', which, as we 
have pointed out, was characterized by the students' turning away from 
the esoteric, quasi-religious atmosphere and thought of the Itten 
circle. At the frequent Bauhaus festivals and evening programmes more 
and more free improvisations and parodies were presented, humorous and 
profane manifestations that were out of tune with the Itten circle's 
hitherto dominant austere Mazdaznan spirituality and lifestyle. Masters 
and students alike participated in these evenings. Some of the events 
were 'thematic', such as the Lantern festival or the Kite festival, 
while other occasions were simply dance parties, which brought about the
 establishment of the Bauhaus band - according to Hans M. Wingler, 'one 
of the most original jazz bands in Germany in the Twenties'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn21" href="#ftn21">21</a>
 Its organizer was a Hungarian Bauhaus student, Andor Weininger, whose 
main instrument was the piano; the band included Heinrich Koch (bells), 
Rudolf Paris (drums), Hans Hoffmann (trumpet), and others. As Gropius 
recalls it, their performances melded 'accordion music and the pounding 
of chairs, the rhythmic smacking of a table and revolver shots in time 
with fragments of German, Slavic, Jewish and Hungarian folk songs .. . 
This dance music soon became known all over Germany and was played at 
artists' festivals everywhere; but since it could never be successfully 
transferred to paper, it remained gaily impromptu, even later when the 
instrumentation was expanded to include two pianos, two saxophones, 
clarinet, trumpet, trombone, banjos, traps, etc.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn22" href="#ftn22">22</a></p>

        <p class="citation">If you are not familiar with the festivals 
of the Bauhaus, then you don't really know the Bauhaus product. These 
festivals arise suddenly, on the most varied pretexts. For example, the 
great winds. Whereupon a gigantic placard is carried all over the 
community: FESTIVAL OF AERIAL GAMES. Two hundred kites of all sizes, 
shapes and colours float in the air at the end of thin strings. There is
 nothing more beautiful than that. Games played by 200 children of all 
ages... Summer brings many other delights, such as the water games known
 as bathing. The burghers are especially incensed, for allegedly the 
Bauhaus folk are fond of forgetting their swimsuits. But this is not 
true. I passed three summers there without a single occasion when the 
two sexes bathed together like that. Of course there were occasional 
exceptions, here and there. Extremely rare. But everyone loved the cold 
water and the stony beach. And boxing. I challenged Gropius, 'the Grand 
Seigneur' himself, to three rounds . . . The winters were even more 
perilous. This is the season when dancing becomes a health 
requirement... the time when girls bloom ... Of course most of the 
credit goes to Andor Weininger, who organized the Bauhaus band. Jazz 
band, accordion, xylophone, saxophone, bombast, revolver. When he sits 
at the piano he reigns over all the masters; he leads, like Admiral 
Scheer, he uplifts, gesticulates, conducts, commands. His smile is 
world-famous … Here the Individual dances are not performed in their 
usual form but as the throbbing pulse of the beat dictates. There are 
special Bauhaus dances, as well … The dancing is suddenly interrupted by
 a resounding crash. All eyes are on the stage. The <em>Bühnenwerkstatt </em>is
 at work. This merits a whole article in itself. The most striking 
farces, bloody tragedies, persiflages, exotlcisms. There is something 
novel here: those spontaneously arising improvisations... Everyone plays
 a part. One after another they take the stage; much of the time the 
action is simultaneously in the middle of the hall, up in the galleries 
and on the podium … The greatest expenditures of energy, however, go 
into the costume parties. The essential difference between the 
fancy-dress balls of the artists of Paris, Berlin, Moscow and the 
Bauhaus is that here the costumes are truly original. Everyone prepares 
his or her own . . . You see monstrously tall shapes stumbling about, 
colourful mechanical figures that yield not the slightest clue as to 
where the head is. Sweet girls inside a red cube. Here comes a winch and
 they are pulled up into the air; lights flash and scents are sprayed. 
And now for a few intimate details about the bigwigs. Kandinsky prefers 
to appear decked out as an antenna, Itten as an amorphous monster, 
Feininger as two right triangles, Moholy-Nagy as a segment pierced by a 
cross, Gropius as Le Corbusier, Muche as an apostle of Mazdaznan, Klee 
as the song of the blue tree.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn23" href="#ftn23">23</a></p>

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">26</span>One novel 
phenomenon, significant from the point of view of the Bauhaus's changing
 profile, was the light- and colour-movement compositions designed by 
two students, Kurt Schwerdtfeger (graphic/printing workshop) and Ludwig 
Hirschfeld-Mack (sculpture workshop), and first displayed at a Bauhaus 
entertainment In 1922. They were patterned after the animated films 
drawn directly on celluloid by Viking Eggeling, Hans</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">27</span>Richter and 
Walter Ruttmann, and their play of light in many ways anticipated 
certain compositions of the later Bauhaus theatre. They consisted of 
coloured cut-out shapes manipulated behind a screen lit by a spotlight 
so that a series of dreamlike abstract compositions, 'light paintings', 
made of moving coloured forms, appeared and dissolved. The colours and 
shapes, as well as the intensity and focus of the light and colours, 
were all variable. The contours of the cut-outs grew vague, or 
multiplied, or else turned into completely sharp outlines.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">28</span>In this rather 
primitive light-show (two more years were needed to perfect it), one 
could already see the motifs that informed the visual art-oriented 
Bauhaus stage productions and also made up the Ideal form-world of 
Constructivist painting and sculpture. The abstract shapes moved about, 
and stayed in continuous motion, the series of colour- and 
form-compositions were constantly changing, and the picture not only 
moved, but moved out into space, that is, dissolved all static 
constraints, and became disembodied as well: light endowed these works 
with a cosmic character. Another animating aspect of this moving colour 
composition was its being brought into existence by technological means,
 via the spotlight, and that design was the decisive aspect of its 
creation. The realization required only a mechanical (at first, manual) 
manipulation - in other words, involved intellectual work of an 
engineering nature, codifiable into mechanically mediated instructions. 
This last detail is one of the most essential elements of the 
constructivist imagination and its Utopias and, as we shall see, will be
 a recurrent theme in more than one Bauhaus production. In fact, this 
vision of 'man at the control panel' will become a central theme; the 
new man whose sphere of activity has shifted from the physical to the 
higher, more exclusively intellectual roles of designer and operator.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">29</span>The new faces and
 voices were brought to life and to the forefront of activity in the 
Bauhaus by currents of the changed historical situation, the same 
currents that removed Johannes Itten from his central position, and not 
much later, in early 1923, swept Lothar Schreyer, too, from the Bauhaus 
scene. The high tide of mystical modes of thought was replaced by the 
even flow of a more everyday mindset. From here on only a real 
philosopher could philosophize - namely, Paul Klee. Klee's cosmic view 
of life and his objective nature studies in no way depended on the ups 
and downs of intellectual currents influenced by history, and he was 
without a doubt the most introspective, most radically philosophic 
painter not only at the Bauhaus but maybe in all of modem art.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">30</span>To replace Itten

history, needed new masters with new visions, to create the new forms

Moholy-Nagy, born in 1895 in the village of Bacsborsdd In southern 
Hungary, left his native land after the fall of the Hungarian soviet 
republic. After a stay of a few weeks in Vienna, he arrived with a 
severe case of influenza In Berlin, where a Quaker couple nursed him 
back to health. Gradually he found his way back to his work as a 
painter.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn26" href="#ftn26">26</a> Soon he became one of the adherents of the most radical, abstract Constructivism. Meanwhile he helped to gather material for <em>MA </em>('Today'),
 the periodical edited by Lajos Kassdk in Vienna; he provided much of 
the news about European art. Moholy-Nagy's studio became the meeting 
place of Dadaist and Constructivist artists. He published articles and 
works in De <em>Stijl, Der Sturm, </em>and in Hungarian-language periodicals in Vienna, Yugoslavia and Romania, as well as in <em>Broom </em>in
 the United States. His relations with De Stijl were not altogether 
without hitches; in early 1923 he published his views under the title 
'Proclamation' in the Hungarian communist paper <em>Egység </em>('Unity'),
 signed together with Ernó' Kállai, László Peri and Alfred Kemény. In 
this, they espoused communist proletkult art and sharply attacked 'the 
constructive (mechanical) aestheticism of De Stijl'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn27" href="#ftn27">27</a> Around this time Kállai made a similar attack on De Stijl in the pages of MA.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn28" href="#ftn28">28</a>
 On Moholy-Nagy's part, there was no sign of a conflict with De Stijl 
before this strange Proclamation, nor did he voice any communist beliefs
 afterwards. Walter Scheidig believes that Gropius showed unusually keen
 diplomatic instinct in selecting László Moholy-Nagy from among the 
Constructivist artists: 'He cleverly avoided inviting one of the leading
 figures, van Doesburg or Lissitzky ... he proposed Moholy-Nagy, who had
 also participated in the Weimar Constructivist Congress.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn29" href="#ftn29">29</a>
 That Gropius might have hesitated for a while between Lissitzky and 
Moholy-Nagy, and that Lissitzky somehow found out about this, or at 
least would have welcomed Gropius's invitation, is indicated by several 
acrimonious letters, full of mud-slinging, written by Lissitzky to his 
wife after Moholy-Nagy's appointment to teach at the Bauhaus.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn30" href="#ftn30">30</a></p>

        </ul>
        <p class="citation">Like a vigorous, eager dog, Moholy burst 
into the Bauhaus circle, ferreting out with unfailing scent the still 
unsolved, still tradition-bound problems in order to attack them. The 
most conspicuous difference between him and the older teachers was a 
lack of the typically German dignity and remoteness prevalent among the 
older 'Masters' as all Bauhaus teachers were called. He never asked what
 impression he made, or whether what he had to suggest would affect 
anyone's ego. He knew neither toga nor cothurnus in his relationship 
with students, and when at first he was often mistaken for a student, he
 was delighted. - We who had already spent several years at the Bauhaus 
were often sceptical of so much innovation, aware of intrigues, 
jealousies, personal advantages; and we certainly never did any work if 
there was the slightest chance that someone else might get credit for 
it. Moholy was totally uninfluenced by these fluctuations in our 
enthusiasm. There never lived anyone more devoted to an objective cause.
 His high opinion of the importance of the Bauhaus remained unimpaired, 
and he devoted himself to it with such fervour that we started to 
discuss his possible collapse. But as a newcomer he got no credit. Many 
of us used him for our own advantage and burdened him with tasks we 
ourselves should have solved. But, with the smiling enthusiasm of a 
child, Moholy accepted all demands, and his vitality seemed unlimited.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn31" href="#ftn31">31</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">36</span>Moholy-Nagy's teaching efforts were characterized by an emphasis on forming the <em>whole man, </em>and
 not merely some specialist limited to a narrow segment of the field - a
 'segment person', in his words. He brought a completely new outlook to 
the Preliminary Course, while essentially following Itten's methods in 
the exercises in the study of materials. In unison with Gropius, he 
based his instruction on an objective and scientific view, with an eye 
to biology, mathematics and technology. He liked logical systems: 
whereas Itten had had his students create free-form compositions in 
montaging diverse textures to develop the sense of touch, Moholy-Nagy 
took special care to have them arrange the different materials according
 to a strict system. Thus tables, curves and circles of touch came into 
existence that illustrated the various materials according to the 
'increments' of their tactile values along a certain parameter of 
quality, such as the gradated scale of rough to smooth, or hard to soft.
 Moholy-Nagy did not allow the actual material to become the subject of 
the exercise: he would admit only the abstract qualities of 'roughness' 
or 'softness' in his curriculum. At the outset of his work at the 
Bauhaus his teaching activity consisted of, among other things, 
transposing various abstract properties, by means of long and 
complicated series of exercises, into qualities that were optically 
perceivable and comprehensible by the students.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn32" href="#ftn32">32</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">37</span>Student projects 
prepared for Moholy-Nagy's Preliminary Course differed fundamentally 
from the work that had been done In Itten's course, primarily in their 
reliance on constructlvist formal elements and their attempt to achieve 
objectivity. The aim was not self-expression, but the amassing of the 
richest possible scale of optical impressions and perceptions: and this 
constituted a higher quality.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">38</span>In contrast to 
Itten, Moholy-Nagy lived in the present every bit as much as Gropius 
did; a thousand ties connected him to the ever-shifting constellations 
of the freshest ideas, tendencies and discoveries. The motivation of his
 artistic work was rooted in his personality, as he had formulated it in
 his adolescence for his brother: 'I am after something new, that has 
not been done by anyone'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn33" href="#ftn33">33</a> - and this ambition represented a bond shared with Gropius.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">39</span>One of Moholy-Nagy's most characteristic concepts, stemming from his willingness to explore new Ideas, was the series of <em>telephone pictures </em>in
 1922. These were small, rectangular enamel-painted compositions he 
designed, and by specifying the dimensions and positions of individual 
pictorial elements on a grid, and their exact hue over the telephone, he
 had them executed at a sign factory. Here Moholy-Nagy anticipated a 
much later concept and practice, belonging to the age of electronics, 
insofar as his procedure was based on the idea that a predesigned 
picture could be translated into an intermediary language - in this case
 numbers conveyed by telephone - and after transmission could be 
retranslated back into its pictorial elements in a realized composition.
 Moholy-Nagy was naturally most interested in the procedure itself - the
 compositions themselves were modest works containing a minimal number 
of pictorial components. Among his utopianistic contemporaries he had 
perhaps the most clear-cut ideas about what direction progress might 
take. At the same time, among his painter colleagues, he was the least 
attached to painting itself: he transferred with extraordinary speed the
 emphasis of his activities from painting to mechanical picture-making 
procedures.</p>                                                </div>        </div>

Alfréd Kemény, Lószló Moholy-Nagy. Vienna, 15 February 1923, p. 51.<br>Relevant
 to this Proclamation, and shedding some light on It, is a letter by 
Auréi Bemáth written Berlin, January 1923; republished in his Utak <em>Pannóniából </em>(Roads Leading from Pannonia). Budapest. 1960. pp. 362-3:<br>'Moholy-Nagy
 was glad to see me; his paintings - well, goodness -1 can't say much 
good about them. Glass architecture. Imagine one hundred canvases - for 
he has at least that many - and on all of them, as if glass figures were
 painted in nice colours...<br>The next day. a get-together at 
Moholy-Nagy's - Hungarians. Komját, Rosinger, Péri, Kállai, Székely - 
some with their wives. The debate was about the revival of the 
periodical Egység and about Constructivism. At times asinine, at times 
brilliant. Komját wants to publish the magazine on a broader basis here,
 but as regards painting he does not want to commit himself to Moholy. 
During the debate it became obvious that both he and Rosinger are fed up
 with the stuff and want no more of it.'</p>

  <p class="notesbaspage"><a class="FootnoteSymbol" href="#bodyftn30" id="ftn30">30</a>  El Lissitzky, Letter to his wife, Sophie Küppers, Moscow, 15 September 1925; in Sophie Lissitzky-Küppers, <em>El Lissitzky. </em>New York Graphic Society, 1968, p. 66:<br>I thought that Moholy would be more careful after the remarks by Kemény in <em>Kunstblatt </em>and G <em>[Zeitschrift für elementare Gestaltung, </em>ed. Hans Richter] and would only deal privately with stuff he has filched, but he is getting brazen. Here are the facts for you:<br>(1)
 1921-2. When I went to Berlin and met Hausmann in Moholy's studio, it 
was decided to publish a periodical. I made out its programme dealing 
with productive, not reproductive, achievements. At that time Moholy 
still had no special subject; I drew his attention to photography. He 
was just preparing his first exhibition for Der Sturm. Neither Hausmann 
nor I took him seriously. At our next meeting Hausmann showed us some 
cuttings from American periodicals about optophonetlcs. There were two 
abstract photos among them, to which I drew Moholy's attention. I am not
 sure whether they were by Man Ray, because his name was not yet known 
to any of us.<br>(2) Spring 1922. Dada Conference in Weimar. Tzara tells about the Champs <em>délicieux. </em>Subsequently
 displayed a few pages in Berlin and Moholy was extremely interested in 
their style of production and got all possible information out of Tzara.<br>(3)
 In the meantime, In 1922-3, he had got to know Loeb, and acquired 
further knowledge. He went to these people and saw the photos by Man Ray
 because they were preparing an issue. Moholy did a series of 'abstract 
photos'!<br>(4) When the issue was being put together, Moholy suppressed
 the things by Man Ray (after all he was far away ... in Paris), and he 
soon got rid of Loeb and Josephson. From Man Ray's photos he selected 
those which did not too strongly resemble his. Then he spiked the 
article by Man Ray, and himself cooked up an intellectual hotchpotch of 
all our slogans. And thus he feigned an achievement. Losovik, who was 
the translator for <em>Broom </em>and also translated Moholy's writing, 
told me all this. Neither Loeb nor Josephson, Losovik nor I, thought any
 more about it: for It is in fact the same thing as saying that Richter 
discovered the abstract film.<br>(5) In Das <em>Kunstblatt </em>(current
 year of Issue, first appearing here) Harold Loeb saw an article 
'Photographie ohne Apparat', with four Illustrations, where the subject 
is very lucidly dealt with.<br>So you have the witnesses - Hausmann, 
Tzara. Losovik, Loeb, Lissitzky - but they are not required at all. One 
should look at the work itself. Moholy wanted to demonstrate to us that 
Man Ray is a Dadaist: objects, no representation of light, etc. But 
Moholy created an abstract light-pattern. The artistic merit of the 
discovery is something completely created by Man Ray. He reaches the 
point of perversity in his complete abstraction of light. The underlying
 theme is both eccentric and American. There you have something of 
merit, and it has character too, even in its weaknesses, because it is 
alive.<br>What has Moholy contributed to it? Light? It has been left in 
the air. Painting? Moholy doesn't know the first thing about that. 
Theme? Where is that to be found? In order to concentrate, you've got to
 have a focal point. Character? That's the mask they always hide behind.
 It's idiotic of me to be taking this Moholy business so seriously, but 
this plagiarism is already getting to be too bare-faced.<br>Another 
letter by El Lissitzky to Sophie Küppers. 16 October 1924, (Ibid., p. 
53): 'By the way, I was told that Moholy is also preparing a book on 
1914-24, in which everything before 1920 is treated as mere fertilizer 
for the Bauhaus, which then accomplishes everything and surpasses all 
that has gone before. Jolly little Idea, what? Scurrilous, sculduggeryl'</p>
