      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">1</span>'THE development
 of art is a thing of slow growth. It requires time and plenty of it. It
 cannot be forced. What would have become of me with insufficient time 
to struggle through my problems? … I found Gropius open to discussion. 
Only he wants to see quick results. For him, "It takes too long. It 
takes too long.'"<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn1" href="#ftn1">1</a>
 Lyonel Feininger, in this letter from the summer of 1919, touched on a 
key motif. Gropius was forced into a race against time, as he well knew 
he would be, even before the founding of the Bauhaus: when an 
institution is run by outside money, the investors want returns in the 
shortest possible time. When in the summer of 1919 he recommended that 
'for the time being we shall refrain from public exhibitions … so that, 
in these turbulent times, we can collect our thoughts', he was fully 
aware that this would be very difficult; there would not be enough time 
for what was most needed, the organic development of inner life and the 
creative process.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">2</span>One facet of the 
conflict between Itten and Gropius was the disparity between their 
attitudes towards time as a factor in politics. Itten could afford to 
stay aloof, and, aside from Mazdaznan, devote all of his attention to 
teaching work - all the more so since it was Gropius's official duty to 
deal with the provincial government and other authorities, and to 
attempt to bring the spontaneous inner development of the Bauhaus on a 
common denominator with the tolerance level of Weimar public opinion.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">3</span>In early 1921 
the balance of power at the Bauhaus, in both personal and artistic 
respects, tipped so much in favour of Itten, that Gropius felt a need to
 assert himself. The hiring of Oskar Schlemmer and Paul Klee provided an
 occasion to moderate Itten's influence. At the 7 February 1921 meeting 
of the Masters' Council Gropius announced that 'it was impracticable 
that Itten and Muche should have to fulfil the form-master duties of 
every workshop. He felt it was likely that in the future every master 
should conduct one or two workshops. Itten objected that this way the 
continuity with the course of formal studies would be broken, since the 
other masters had no contact with that' (i.e., the Preliminary Course).<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn2" href="#ftn2">2</a>
 On 15 March the workshops were redistributed. Accordingly, the 
stone-carving workshop was now headed by Schlemmer, the wood sculpture 
shop by Muche, the cabinet-making shop went to Gropius, the printing 
workshop to Feininger, and bookbinding to Klee (who had been contracted 
to teach a course in 'form studies'); Muche remained the form instructor
 for weaving, and Itten retained the artistic direction of the metal 
workshop and wall- and glass-painting shops. However, Gropius urged 
closer contacts between the workshops for the sake of a spirit of 
cooperation at the school, and therefore requested the masters to give a
 series of lectures to acquaint the others with the work of their 
respective shops. 'Since Mr Itten has the richest store of experience 
among us in this respect, he will begin the series of lectures,' Gropius
 declared.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn3" href="#ftn3">3</a> The 
problem, however, was not so much the attunement of the artistic-formal 
aspects of the various workshops, but the discrepancies between the 
theoretical formal studies - the Preliminary Course - and the practical 
workshop activities. After the completion of the Preliminary Course the 
students entered one of the workshops - the one found most suitable for 
the unfolding of their abilities on the basis of the assignments chosen 
and analysed with such sensitivity and empathy according to Itten's 
art-pedagogical methodology. Once in the workshop, however, suddenly 
there was no more of the fine-honed attention to the smallest details of
 their inner vibrations and Impulses: they were now expected to master 
certain tricks of the trade, they had to learn a handicraft. 
Notwithstanding the dual leadership of workshops, there was no return to
 the highly charged psychic energies of the Preliminary Course; the goal
 was no longer self-realization, but the realization of an object. And 
no amount of such activity could supplant the everyday contact with 
Itten's magnetic personality and readily proffered philosophy of life.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">4</span>The balance 
between the Preliminary Course and the Bauhaus workshops was upset. Or, 
to put it more precisely, in spite of its small extent relative to the 
whole, the Preliminary Course, through Itten, had come to carry such 
surplus weight that it was impossible to give it all the room it 
demanded - having overgrown its own framework. Uncertainty and tension 
reigned among the students; more and more of them left the Bauhaus for 
walking tours of Italy. Oskar Schlemmer wrote in a letter to his wife on
 3 March 1921: 'In strict confidence now: things look bad for the 
Bauhausl Six more students want to leave for Italy.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn4" href="#ftn4">4</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">5</span>There was 
another circumstance that further complicated the tensions at the 
Bauhaus in 1921-2. One of the founding members of the Dutch De Stijl 
movement, the editor of its periodical and in fact its most active 
proponent. Theo van Doesburg (originally C.E.M. Küpper, also writing 
under the pseudonyms I.K. Bonset and Aldo Camini), had arrived at 
Weimar. The programme of De Stijl In part almost coincided with that of 
the Bauhaus - as far as it concerned reshaping the human environment and
 following collective goals - and in part opposed it, insofar as De 
Stijl, as the name itself indicates, meant the creation of a style: a 
uniform, universally valid, new style that would foreshadow the 
universal harmony the movement's members hoped to advance by their 
works. In 1920, van Doesburg, the group's internationally most mobile 
member, made a grand tour of Europe with the purpose of spreading the 
teachings of De Stijl. Doesburg himself was an architect, and his many 
personal contacts were primarily with architects: this is how in 1920 he
 first met, through Bruno Taut in Berlin, Walter Gropius and the 
draughtsmen at his office, Adolf Meyer and Alfr6d Forbát. At the 7 
February 1921 meeting of the Masters' Council the minutes record the 
reading of two letters from Doesburg requesting approval for an article 
he intended to write about the Bauhaus. 'However, since Doesburg's 
Intentions were not favourably received, Mr Gropius undertook the task 
of writing a letter refusing the request.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn5" href="#ftn5">5</a> This was the first sign of friction between the Bauhaus and van Doesburg.</p>

      </ul>
      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">6</span>As background to
 the rapidly developing animosity between Theo van Doesburg and the 
Bauhaus we must note that the De Stijl movement and the Bauhaus were 
entities of very different specific gravity. De Stijl never became an 
organized group, but was a loosely affiliated banding together of 
like-minded avant-garde artists and intellectuals, among whom only the 
painters observed closely the theosophical teachings about harmony that 
assigned a special role to right angles enclosed by straight horizontal 
and vertical lines, and to primary colours. Besides this doctrine, which
 rigidified into a dogma, the movement had little else in common. The 
periodical De <em>Stijl </em>was published by van Doesburg at his own 
expense, and one reason he needed international contacts was the 
relative indifference shown by the Dutch middle class towards the 
movement. In the hurly-burly of the European art scene more than one 
avant-garde art periodical was born, only to flourish briefly and pass 
away, reflecting the fortunes of the art movements grouped around them. 
However, aside from VKhUTEMAS In far-off Moscow, the Bauhaus was the 
only state-funded modernist art institute in all of Europe. Regardless 
of the struggles It cost to assure the Bauhaus of its share in the 
Thuringian state budget, the school still towered as a rock-solid 
bastion over the frail and unfunded avant-garde groups. It was able to 
purchase materials and supplies, could afford to pay salaries to its 
faculty (all of them respected leading avant-garde artists!), was 
qualified to issue diplomas, possessed the status of a legal entity - 
and occupied that privileged position in the progressive, opposition 
wing of the official, professional establishment which, if we are to 
believe Tom Wolfe's reasoning,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn6" href="#ftn6">6</a>
 is the dream of most avant-garde artists. De Stijl, or any other group 
of artists, could not even dream of receiving such institutional 
support.</p>

      </ul>
      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">7</span>How and why van 
Doesburg found himself in Weimar is difficult to establish on the basis 
of conflicting memoirs. He himself stated in the 1927 jubilee issue of 
De <em>Stijl </em>that Gropius at their first meeting had invited him 
for a visit, and later, during his visit in 1921, invited him to work at
 the Bauhaus.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn7" href="#ftn7">7</a> As
 opposed to this, Gropius in several letters claims that he had never 
invited Doesburg to the Bauhaus. 'He came of his own accord, because he 
was Interested in our courses. He had hopes of receiving a teaching 
appointment at the Bauhaus, but I did not give him a job, for I found 
him to be aggressive and a fanatic who held narrow-minded, doctrinaire 
views, without the ability to brook criticism.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn8" href="#ftn8">8</a>
 As Lothar Schreyer recalls it, at the time that van Doesburg showed up,
 there happened to be an unfilled position at the Bauhaus to which they 
had intended to invite a Constructivist artist. Doesburg would have been
 the logical choice, since he had spent so much time in Weimar and was 
in personal contact with Gropius, but his name did not come up among the
 nominees.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn9" href="#ftn9">9</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">8</span>Thus van 
Doesburg, who may actually have had hopes of a Bauhaus teaching 
position, moved to Weimar. Adolf Meyer found a studio for him, and one 
of the Bauhaus students, Karl-Peter Röhl, offered the use of his own 
studio for van Doesburg's lectures. Van Doesburg informed Meyer of his 
impending move: 'Soon I intend to travel to Weimar, and work there for a
 while. I believe this way I can contribute to the realization of a 
monumental collective style. This has been the aim of our group, to 
which the efforts of the Bauhaus are in such close proximity. Perhaps in
 Weimar we shall succeed in creating a new centre of gravity to oppose 
the individualism of Paris.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn10" href="#ftn10">10</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">9</span>For a while, 
Doesburg had hoped that he could participate in the Bauhaus's work - 
although he had in mind a Bauhaus according to his own theories. 
Meanwhile he set up a counter-course of his own in Weimar. There were 
two aspects of the Bauhaus that he objected to: Expressionism based on 
individualism, especially as practised by Itten, and the fact that 
Gropius had advertised a school of architecture but was not teaching 
architecture at the Bauhaus, while maintaining a private architectural 
office within the walls of the school. On both points his attack proved 
effective. The young people who had recently entered the Bauhaus - 
Karl-Peter Röhl, Werner Graeff, Walter Dexel, Kurt Schmidt, Helmuth von 
Erffa and others - were in search of a philosophy of life just like 
their slightly older fellow-students, but had not yet come to accept 
Itten's teachings, or else were immune to them. So they, as well as 
others not enrolled at the Bauhaus, found a treasure trove in van 
Doesburg's lectures, with their consistent, simple and incontrovertible 
insistence on order and harmony, heralding the coming of a new style 
based on modem mechanization, composed of horizontal-vertical 
coordinates. The masters at the Bauhaus looked on at Doesburg's 
activities in Weimar with growing disapproval. Doesburg himself, 
naturally with some exaggeration, claimed that they 'wished him to 
leave', that 'in the winter of 1921, his windows had been broken; what 
was more, traces of revolver shots could be found on them [there is no 
other evidence to corroborate this]. In addition, Bauhaus students were 
"prohibited" from attending Stijl events in Weimar.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn11" href="#ftn11">11</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">10</span>Van Doesburg 
was filled with extraordinary resentment. In January 1921 he wrote to a

academy with the most up-to-date teachersl I spoke with students every 
evening, spreading the toxin of the new ideas everywhere. There will be a

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">11</span>Van Doesburg 
had considerable influence on Schlemmer. In the light of his views 
Schlemmer came to see things more critically: 'To give you an idea: the 
Bauhaus has no course in architecture … And yet the Bauhaus stands for 
the primacy of architecture. The blame falls on Gropius, who is the only
 architect at the Bauhaus but has no time for teaching. A programme 
could be set up (theoretically), but It would be hard to implement … I 
am not resentful and eager for a putsch … What I would like to see is 
this: more architecture at the Bauhaus, more discipline in the other 
fields; the Bauhaus should seek out, collect, and preserve all the 
possible laws of artistic production.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn14" href="#ftn14">14</a>
 A year and a half later he writes: 'What do I want? To create a style 
in painting which springs from a necessity beyond fad and aesthetic 
form, which can hold its own against the perfect utility of functional 
objects and machines. - This style must thus necessarily be ethical in 
nature … I do not believe in craftsmanship... Handmade <em>objets d'art </em>in the age of the machine and technology would be a luxury for the rich, lacking a broad popular basis and roots in the people.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn15" href="#ftn15">15</a> All of these ideas are echoes of van Doesburg; they stayed with Schlemmer for a long time.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">12</span>It would seem 
that Doesburg did not refrain from intrigues, either. In November 1921 
Feininger writes: 'Yesterday I had a visit from van Doesburg. We had a 
long talk together. He at least is very real and of healthy flesh and 
blood. He was rather explicit on Monsieur Itten. It seems this champion 
of theosophy at times does not act up to the role. He is said to have 
ripped down my work and to have left hardly a shred of my person, which 
is gratifying. Anyhow he did it publicly - he should come to grips with 
me and we might get even.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn16" href="#ftn16">16</a>

Doesburg was obviously inciting a rift within the Bauhaus by setting 
Feininger against Itten.</p>

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">13</span>In addition to 
his efforts to deepen the polarization within the Bauhaus, van Doesburg 
became engaged in a large-scale International organizing activity. In 
fact he and Gropius had similar motivations: just as Gropius had 
perceived the world-renowned town of Weimar as the possible capital of a
 'republic of the spirit', so van Doesburg had in mind a European 
perspective and international ambitions when he approached Weimar as a 
new artistic centre potentially opposed to Paris. But he was determined 
that it would be under his flag that Weimar should achieve equal rank 
with Paris.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">14</span>His wounded 
feelings merely inflated the scope of his ambitions. In 1922, when it 
became obvious that he would not receive a teaching post at the Bauhaus -
 Gropius's hiring of Kandinsky in June had clinched this fact - van 
Doesburg was moved to take extreme action. In September of that year he 
launched a concerted attack from all sides on the Bauhaus.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">17</span>Van Doesburg's 
ravings were not without cause. In 1922 the survival of the avant-garde 
was indeed a matter of life and death. The fervid Utopias that arose in 
the 1910s and placed their hopes not only in the revolution, but, as 
György Lukács said, international revolution, continued to balloon until
 they peaked around 1922, when, their fire spent, the dreamers of 
Utopias found themselves back on the damp and cold ground of reality. 
Van Doesburg, the Constructivist painter, designer, architect and 
Dadaist poet, felt these changes on his own skin, and well understood 
the meaning of Hans Richter and El Lissitzky's statement at the 
Dusseldorf Congress in May 1922: 'Today we are still in between two 
societies: one of which has no use for us; the other whose time has not 
yet come.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn20" href="#ftn20">20</a> At
 this time, in 1922, van Doesburg could very well have used the Bauhaus 
for the gratification of his overweening ambition, an appropriate throne
 for the high priest of the European avant-garde. Indeed, It would have 
seemed his only chance for survival as a progressive artist and for 
salvaging avant-garde values for a new historical era.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">19</span>Itten took a 
twofold line of attack against Gropius and the limitation of his own 
role. At the 1 October 1921 meeting of the Masters' Council he proposed -
 aware of his own popularity and influence - that the students should be
 allowed a free choice of form masters. On the other front, he declared 
against the functioning of the Bauhaus, an educational institution, in 
any business capacity. He objected to the judging of the students' work 
by anyone other than the masters - such as the firm buying their works -
 lest the school turn Into 'a source of income for the state'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn21" href="#ftn21">21</a>
 But this is precisely what the Bauhaus was being forced to allow, no 
matter how much it went against the grain of its pedagogical principles,
 because only an output of objects usable by the population could 
justify it in front of the constantly hostile Weimar public. There was 
no time for certain essential components of the pedagogic effort: the 
making of long-range plans for years ahead, the process of maturation, 
the possibility, the right to make mistakes. They had to produce 
immediately. Besides, the students' living expenses had to be covered. 
In the midst of rapidly worsening inflation and the hard reality of a 
country at an economic nadir, this was the only chance for generating 
some income to enable the students to stay on at the Bauhaus. Gropius 
was not able to accept Itten's proposals, and this further sharpened the
 conflict between them. After this, Itten no longer bothered to observe 
proper procedures. 'Itten allegedly carries Mazdaznan principles into 
the classroom, differentiating between the adherents and non-adherents 
on the basis of ideology rather than on the basis of achievement. So 
apparently a special clique is being formed and is splitting the Bauhaus
 into two camps, the teachers also being drawn In. Itten has managed to 
have his course made the only required one; he further controls the 
important workshops and has a rather considerable, admirable ambition: 
to put his stamp on the Bauhaus.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn22" href="#ftn22">22</a>
 So writes Oskar Schlemmer in December 1921. Now this is the situation: 
Gropius is an excellent diplomat, businessman, and practical genius. In 
the Bauhaus he has a large private office, and he receives commissions 
for building villas in Berlin. Berlin, business and lucrative 
commissions, partially or hardly understood by the students (whom 
Gropius wants to help get jobs this way) - these are scarcely the best 
prerequisites for Bauhaus work. Itten is right to attack this practice 
and demand that the students be allowed to work undisturbed. But Gropius
 contends that we should not shut out life and reality, a danger (if it 
is a danger) implied by Itten's method; for instance, workshop students 
might come to find meditation and ritual more important than their work.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn23" href="#ftn23">23</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">20</span>By involving 
Mazdaznan in his teaching activities Itten not only infringed the 
constitution of the Bauhaus, but also sinned against the purity of his 
own pedagogical principles and methods. At this time he used Mazdaznan 
both as an ideology and as an instrument in his struggle for power. The 
tenets of Mazdaznan, in addition to and in place of their meaning in and
 of themselves, now received a local validity vis-à-vis the current 
situation: to be an adherent of Mazdaznan meant first and foremost 
taking Itten's side against Gropius.</p>

 - which was, in this case, not a general statement of theory, but a 
defence of Itten's rights -the Bauhaus masters, Instead of taking sides 
in the struggle, felt It was more important to preserve unity and the 
school's integrity by having Gropius and Itten reach a compromise and 
thereby assure the undisturbed continuance of work. Although they all 
considered Itten's activities and influence excessive, no one wanted his
 departure, not even Gropius, whose view of the situation, in the final 
analysis, was similar to Klee's. He wrote in a letter: 'I got entangled 
in a difficult duel with Itten. I want to remain strong, but at the same
 time I wish him to stay; <em>both of </em>us are <em>essential.</em><a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn27" href="#ftn27">27</a><em>' </em>(Emphasis
 added.) Schlemmer develops this in more detail: Itten's departure 
'would certainly mean a loss for the Bauhaus. Pedagogically he is more 
skilled than the rest, and he has a decided talent for leadership. I 
sense all too keenly the lack of those qualities in myself. Furthermore:
 when Gropius need no longer fear the strong opposition of Itten, he

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">24</span>Thus there was 
general agreement that Itten should be retained because of his 
indispensable value to the community, while his personal sphere of 
influence and the extent of his activities should be limited to the 
channels where they would be of optimal benefit to the <em>entire </em>Bauhaus
 community. Not only the masters, but by this time the students as well,
 began to see Itten in this light. Helmuth von Erffa writes, 'Meanwhile a
 silent revolt against Itten was growing. It came into the open in 
December 1921, when the Bauhaus celebrated a very expressionistic 
Christmas Eve. Gifts were opened in the presence of all and greetings 
read and shown about. Itten received from a group of students the 
equivalent of a joking valentine which requested him to kindly stay out 
of some of the workshops. When I asked older students about it I was 
told that he was disturbing them and trying to give advice in technical 
matters he knew nothing about.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn29" href="#ftn29">29</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">25</span>The Bauhaus was 
indeed on the way towards functioning as a whole, an organism striving 
to reach a state of equilibrium and inner harmony. If there were two 
valid principles at a given moment of history, then both of them would 
be represented within the walls of the school. Schlemmer's observation 
that without Itten to keep him in check, Gropius would 'constitute by 
far the greater threat', points to the fact that not only principles, 
but individuals, too, need to be kept in check. The victor in an obvious
 power struggle will understandably arouse concern in the members of the
 community, no matter which side wins: his increased power goes with a 
decrease in the forces that kept it in check. At the same time, in order
 for the spiritual 'whole' to come about as originally conceived by 
Gropius, both principles as described by Schlemmer, the mystical and the
 rationalistic, represented by Itten and Gropius respectively, should 
have come to terms, and by coexisting and collaborating in peace should 
have shown an example of true and profound tolerance, understanding and 
selflessness. Voluntary self-limitation was needed.</p>

      </ul>
      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">26</span>Sooner or later
 the actual conflict latent in the situation was bound to resurface: 
this occurred in January 1922. Gropius found out that in the 
cabinet-making workshop, which, according to the earlier decision, 
belonged to him, Itten, without prior consultation, had initiated new 
projects and was ordering fresh supplies. Gropius wrote to Itten, 
requesting him not to start new work in this workshop. He referred to 
their agreement, according to which Gropius would not interfere with 
projects already under way, while requesting Itten to honour the other 
provision of the agreement, by not starting any new work projects.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn30" href="#ftn30">30</a>
 Itten replied that the work involved had been planned for nine months, 
and its realization anticipated for two and a half years. It would 
benefit both the students and the Bauhaus. 'And now, instead, your 
architectural commissions will have to be executed, which I feel to be 
harmful under the conditions, and therefore oppose.' In the same letter 
he resigned from his position in the cabinet-making, metalwork, wood- 
and stone-sculpture workshops, and refused any responsibility having to 
do with these. 'So my activity in the workshops is over. - I am limiting
 the time devoted to teaching to the number of hours given by other 
masters; in other words, I am ceasing my entire compulsory teaching 
load. I am also informing you that I have lost all of my deeper interest
 in the Bauhaus.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn31" href="#ftn31">31</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">27</span>This was an 
overreaction and it might have been partially precipitated by the 
Christmastime practical joke, and the general feeling that the changing 
times and tastes were pointing away from all that Itten stood for. 
Gropius's response was glum. He reminded Itten that in effect nothing 
had really happened to justify such a series of steps; at the same time 
he stated that the tensions between the two of them were due to 
personal. not to objective, causes. 'For some time past you have shown a
 regular hatred towards my person … and this, much to my regret, 
paralyses our collaboration.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn32" href="#ftn32">32</a>
 He requested Itten to continue his teaching until the end of the 
semester, for the sake of the students. Itten agreed to this, concluding
 his reply: 'In the hope that I have withdrawn sufficiently far away for
 you to freely realize your plans and intentions, without my 
observations standing in your way, and in order to end all arguments, I 
close this final communication - Johannes Itten.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn33" href="#ftn33">33</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">28</span>So Itten proved 
unwilling to accept his new, limited role; he, too, wanted all or 
nothing. He was ready to give up his irreplaceable and invaluable 
pedagogic work because his personal ambitions were not about to be 
fulfilled. I have already quoted Gropius's statement: 'I am coming to 
Weimar full of excitement and with the firm intention of creating one 
great Whole, or else, failing that, to disappear quickly.' Van Doesburg 
and Itten were motivated by the same ambition and pride that refused to 
put up with failure. These lines could have been written by Itten, 
perhaps the only difference being that at the outset Itten's Ideas were 
not as well defined as Gropius's. He had an informal, spiritual 
leadership in mind, intending to become no mere director, but the 
actual, essential centre of things.</p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">29</span>It seemed that 
Itten's extremism and inflexibility, his intolerance in a religious 
sense, had precipitated a decision on Gropius's part to take a stand and
 announce a new turn of events. After his exchange of letters with 
Itten, in February 1922 Gropius took the step that the others had 
feared, and brought the affair in front of the inner forum of the 
Bauhaus. He addressed a circular to the Bauhaus masters, requesting 
their response. 'Master Itten has again faced us with a decision: either
 to produce individualized pieces of work that go counter to the 
commercially oriented outside world or to seek contacts with industry … I
 look for unity in the fusion, not in the separation, of these 
approaches to life.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn34" href="#ftn34">34</a>
 Then, in reformulating one of the essential points of the 1919 Bauhaus 
programme, that of sequestration from society, he went on to proclaim 
its very opposite: 'The Bauhaus could become a haven for eccentrics if 
it were to lose contact with the work and working methods of the outside
 world. Its responsibility consists in educating people to recognize the
 basic nature of the world in which they live, and in combining their 
knowledge with their imagination so as to be able to create typical 
forms that symbolize that world … If we were to reject the world around 
us completely, the only remaining way out would be the "romantic 
island". I see a danger to our youth in the indications of a wild 
romanticism'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn35" href="#ftn35">35</a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">30</span>Gropius naturally
 did not raise objections to Itten's personality, but to all that he 
stood for. In this memorandum, dating from early 1922, sensing the 
gradual lifting of the Expressionist fog, Gropius anticipates later 
events, and questions even the programme of crafts training that he 
formulated earlier. He reaches at the same time towards the future of 
industrial design and towards his earlier ideas about it.</p>

 whose response was jointly signed by Klee, Feininger, Muche, Itten, and
 Schlemmer, wrote down a symbolic story about an artist who dreamed of a
 colour composition for a flowerbed, and handed his plan over to a 
gardener for realization. The gardener shook his head and protested: he 
could not plant the drought-loving cactus next to a water-lily, nor 
would it make sense to plant a flower blooming in October next to one 
flowering in April, for the desired effect would not be seen. Whereupon 
the painter exclaimed, 'You're no gardener at alll' Marcks went on to 
conclude, 'The moral is: as far as the aesthetics of the machine are 
concerned, the Bauhaus came into being from our hope, groping in the 
darkness, that our students would become what, alas, none of us were - 
both masters of form and masters of handicraft, in one and the same 
person.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn38" href="#ftn38">38</a> The 
confrontation of Groplus and Itten leads us back to a statement In the 
Manifesto, 'art cannot be taught'. By drawing a qualitative and 
gradational distinction between art and craft ('the artist is an exalted
 craftsman'), Groplus divided creative work into two phases: the first 
one could be taught and was therefore socially controllable - this was 
craftsmanship, technical proficiency which flexibly adapts to modem 
industrial technology and contemporary requirements - and the second one
 not teachable, not controllable, and inevitably not even directable, 
which we may call Intuition, individual inspiration, or, as Groplus did,
 'rare moments of inspiration'. And since the Bauhaus was a collective, 
the experimental model of a 'great Whole', it was of prime importance 
that whatever could be taught should be made public property - while 
that which could not be taught could not be shared completely by any 
community.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">34</span>By insisting on 
the rights of the autonomous artist, Itten compelled Gropius to take the
 side of the socially committed designer, no matter how much the latter 
would have liked the peaceful unification of these two functions.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">35</span>Everyday reality -
 the external pressure for proof of utility, and the internal movements 
towards inner equilibrium at the Bauhaus - demanded the acceptance of 
one, and the rejection of the other of these two alternatives: creative 
work was either going to be made collective, or not. Essentially this 
meant a critique of Groplus's notion of the joining and fruitful 
collaboration of art and technology, of artist and craftsman. The 
artist, in this case Itten, refused to collaborate or partake in work 
processes that were not based on artistic values. In his Manifesto 
Gropius had distinguished between art and craft most probably for the 
sake of a clear distinction between distant and immediate goals, as well
 as out of respect for the unteachable component. He did not intend to 
exercise the least control or influence over what, according to his 
lights, was neither controllable nor knowable. At the same time, as his 
June 1919 address testifies, he attempted to place art in its entirety 
beyond the pale of the school's concerns. From the viewpoint of the 
Bauhaus as a collective, he decided that for the time being the 
potentially sharable, and therefore teachable, manual techniques had to 
be kept separate from the unknowable creative energies swirling at the 
depths of the individual psyche. He had to present everyone with a '<em>tabula rasa' </em>on which no one had any 'positional advantage' by way of some given ability that was not 'acquired through hard work'.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">36</span>Possibly Gropius 
himself had not realized that he had imagined the Bauhaus along the 
lines of a well-designed functional object, in which only those details 
are beautiful that are also useful for the object as a whole. Yet it was
 just this idea, stemming from Gropius's original value system - and 
that this notion, although relegated to the background for some years, 
had remained unchanged, is evinced by a 'slip' in the Manifesto: 
'unproductive artist' - which endowed the meanings of the words <em>artist </em>and <em>craftsman </em>with
 certain ethical overtones. This made the 'artist' - Itten - stand for 
an individualistic attitude that ignored public interest and the 
creation of 'forms readily understood by everyone', and instead of 
acting as a participating member of society, remained a 'solitary 
eccentric' imprisoned in a 'romantic insularity' - in contrast to the 
designer who turns to address the needs of the community. Such an 
opposition meant a drawing away from the spirit of the Manifesto, from 
the proclamation of the union of 'architects, painters, sculptors', and 
approached the views held by a society hostile to avant-garde art about 
the incomprehensible and cranky 'modern artist' and the 'honest 
craftsman'. This was the road leading to the extreme where artistic 
talent and creativity would be labelled an 'apelike excitability'.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">37</span>The Preliminary 
Course and the workshops comprised separate worlds, and their essential 
differences could only symptomatically and temporarily be glossed over 
by the fact that Itten extended the sphere of his activities to cover 
the workshops as well. For the workshops could not accommodate the 
enormous creative imagination and energies liberated by Itten's 
Preliminary Course in his students. All this had to be subordinated to 
professional discipline and technical constraints in the workshops, just
 as in Gerhard Marcks's parable: no matter how wonderful the colour 
compositions dreamed up by the students for their symbolic gardens, the 
basic characteristics of the various crafts made some of them physically
 impossible to realize. The conflict, translated into the language of 
Bauhaus praxis, meant that either Itten had to take over total direction
 of the programme, no matter what dilettantism this would bring to the 
workshops, or else the Preliminary Course had to be altered radically so
 that it acted entirely in the spirit of, and as preparation for, the 
subsequent workshop training.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">38</span>Even though the 
issue, in words and deeds as regards the inner structure of the Bauhaus,
 was the role and meaning of the arts in the value system of the school,
 the rest of the painting masters, Klee, Kandinsky, Schreyer and 
Schlemmer, did not come to the defence of Itten and autonomous creative 
freedom. They, too, thought in terms of the situation, and refused to 
interfere in the single combat of Itten and Gropius. In spite of all 
theoretical aspects, this was clearly a private conflict, an affair of 
honour that concerned only the two of them.</p>

'These two alternatives strike me as typical of current trends in 
Germany. On the one hand, the influence of oriental culture, the cult of
 India, also a return to nature In the Wandervogel movement and the 
others like it; also communes, vegetarianism, Tolstoyism, reaction 
against the war; and, on the other hand, the American spirit, progress,

    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">40</span>Above and beyond 
personal ambitions and rivalries, the higher historical forces evidently
 had a say in the outcome of this episode in the eternal struggle of the
 two principles. The awesome clashes of rationalism and mysticism, 
exalted utilitarianism and the Irrational disguised behind a mask of 
reason, were to follow each other in rapid succession on the German 
horizon. Itten and Gropius's conflict was merely one humble scene in a 
vast drama, one that moreover did not result in a synthesis, as a result
 of the playwright's whim in granting rationalism a brief reprieve.</p>
    <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">41</span>In the end, 
Gropius managed to stay on top of the situation. The Bauhaus masters 
placed greater value on the survival of the school than on the hegemony 
of their private philosophies. Thanks to his memorandum, and the 
self-restraint of the masters, bringing his fight with Itten into the 
open did not deteriorate into ad <em>hominem </em>attacks, but instead 
directed attention towards such unsolved issues, of concern for everyone
 at the Bauhaus, as the twofold leadership of workshops, art and craft, 
the relation of art to the machine, the reconciliation of communal 
interests with the unfolding of the individual, and contacts with 
factories.</p>

 and in April-May the exhibition of the Bauhaus students' work opened, 
to travel later In the year to Calcutta, with the help of Rabindranath 
Tagore. The exhibition displayed mostly works created in the Preliminary
 Course, accompanied by a few workshop pieces. Itten, who wrote the text
 of the pamphlet accompanying the exhibition of his students' work,

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">43</span>In the summer 
of 1922 the masters of the Bauhaus, too, participated in an exhibition 
at the Weimar Landesmuseum, where, in the rooms on the right-hand side, 
the 'First Thuringian Art Exhibition' showed traditional paintings by 
the masters of the reorganized fine arts academy, among them Klemm and 
Engelmann, while in the rooms on the left Feininger, Klee, Itten, 
Marcks, Muche, Schreyer and a few abstract painters of Weimar showed 
their works. This exhibition was of course condemned, in close 
association with the students' works, the general opinion being that at 
the Bauhaus 'sick souls are misleading the youth into useless 
activities'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn45" href="#ftn45">45</a> 
The Thuringian press - in contrast to the nationwide acclaim -renewed 
its attacks on the Bauhaus. Again the school's position became critical.
 The political right - which in June had assassinated in Berlin the 
foreign minister Walter Rathenau, who happened to be a Jew - reached 
such extremes in the Thuringian papers as the article by the architect 
Arthur Buschmann in the <em>Jenaische Zeitung, </em>in which he referred
 to the maquettes of a modem housing project at the Bauhaus exhibition 
as 'an attempt to return to the primitive art forms of inferior races', 
and took the opportunity to issue a warning about the dangers of 
miscegenation.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn46" href="#ftn46">46</a></p>

      <p class="texte"><span class="paranumber">44</span>One month 
before the publication of this article Kandinsky had accepted Gropius's 
invitation, and the man who was perhaps the most respected modem artist 
in Europe joined the Bauhaus faculty. In November of the same year the 
Russian Art Exhibition (the first to be held abroad since 1917) opened 
at the Van Diemen gallery in Berlin; with this. Constructivism appeared 
on German soil to start its afterlife as an international art movement. 
Although the term 'Constructivism' came into use only as late as 1921, 
its actual active period occurred years earlier; its Utopias, as the 
Russian artists now arriving in Berlin discovered to their surprise, 
belonged to the same spheres of thought as the ideas of the radical 
German artists. 'In Russia, during the seven years of total isolation, 
we faced the same problems as our friends in the west, without either of
 us being aware of this,' said llya Ehrenburg and El Lissitzky in May 
1922 in Düsseldorf.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn47" href="#ftn47">47</a>
 However, the historical phase teeming with Utopias had passed. Oskar 
Schlemmer had noted this in his diary in June 1922; but its most moving 
expression came from the pen of a Russian writer, Mikhail Slonimsky, who
 put the following words into the mouth of a suicide revolutionary in 
his short story published in 1923, and most probably written in 1922:</p>

 1922, pp. 135-7. For the sake of completeness, the text of a letter 
sent by Theo van Doesburg to the Bauhaus two years later, in May 1924, 
deserves quoting in full:<br>To Mr Moholy-Nagy, requesting him to read this letter at a meeting of the Masters' Council.<br>Yesterday
 I received a brochure from Mr Arno Müller, entitled 'The State Bauhaus 
and Its Director'. After reading this my impression was that the 
brochure was written chiefly for personal and political motives for the 
purpose of destroying the Bauhaus, using any sordid means available, 
thanks to the current political situation in Germany. It does not 
contain any proposals for reorganization. I was astonished that this 
brochure quoted an excerpt from an article I published In De <em>Stijl </em>in 1922, and did so without my permission, indeed without even notifying me in any manner. Furthermore, <em>my article </em>[Emphasis
 added.] was not even reprinted in its entirety. Among others, the last 
section was omitted, wherein I summed up my opinion of how the artistic 
and pedagogical direction of the Bauhaus should be implemented in line 
with the programme of 1919.<br>I am afraid that this might give the 
impression that I share the views of Fritz Hall and Miss Freytag von 
Loringhoven (with whom I find myself in the same boat).<br>This, as well as the undistinguished character of the brochure, compels me to take a stand.<br>Needless
 to say I had nothing to do with this brochure. I ask the masters of the
 State Bauhaus to indulge my broken German, and consider my sole and 
unalterable views on this matter:<br>When I first learned about the 
Bauhaus and its activity in the field of art I became extremely 
interested. Inasmuch as its strivings were similar to the Dutch 
endeavours already in progress, I Intended to join the cause - without 
the slightest personal <em>motivation - </em>so that I could help the struggle with my artistic and propaganda activities, <em>independently of the Bauhaus. </em>(I
 recall what Mr Walter Groplus said about our 'Styl-work' in 1920, when I
 first showed him photographs: 'The artists of the Styl [sic] are much 
farther ahead than we, but we do not wish to nurture dogmas at the 
Bauhaus. Everyone should express his own creative individuality,' etc., 
etc.) When I travelled to Weimar (led not only by personal initiative) 
and began to work there Independently of the Bauhaus (letter to Mr 
Gropius), I received a totally different impression of the Bauhaus.<br>My
 apartment on Am Horn (and later my studio on Sch. Graben) became a 
meeting place for those persons who offered sharp criticism of the inner
 structure of the Bauhaus (with which I was unfamiliar).<br>These people were not simply opponents of the Bauhaus, but also its friends, <em>masters and students, </em>and
 close associates of the director. They were the ones who turned to me 
for criticism. At the time of my residence in Weimar I thought it very 
strange that the people interested in my ideas could only learn about 
them in a clandestine manner, and that there could be no possibility of 
developing such a new artistic approach at the Bauhaus, of all places. 
This did not seem to be consonant with the widely promulgated Bauhaus 
manifestos, such as:<br>'The exchange of ideas with representatives of the revolutionary art of neighbouring countries.' (I am quoting from memory.)<br>Instead of the 'friendly reception of foreign colleagues' I experienced only increasing narrow-mindedness and hostility.<br>This
 inexplicable behaviour of the Bauhaus leadership toward me, furtive, 
behind my back; the inner split within the Bauhaus; the contradictions 
between a (basically) sensible programme and its application in 
practice; the undisciplined work methods, the lack of any relation 
between master and master, master of form and master of technique, and 
master and student; the capricious, individualistic artistic production -
 in short: the entire dichotomy and dispersal of energies invited my 
criticism.<br>It is common knowledge, and my friends in Weimar will bear me out, that even if my criticism was sharp, <em>it
 originated exclusively in my artistic and theoretical differences with 
the Bauhaus. and was always based on its fundamental programme. </em>(This was the subject of the article published in De <em>Stijl.)</em><br><em>Far </em>was it from me to indulge in mudslinging, and I always firmly rejected any approaches towards that end.<br>My own criticism was always sincere and open, free of any personal interests.<br>I never attacked the Bauhaus as such, nor any single Individual.<br>The chief points of my critique ('et quand-même elle tourne') were as follows:<br>1. The discrepancy between the programmatic tasks and their implementation.<br>2.
 The impossibility of achieving the collective, integral work of 
architecture, for lack of discipline, for lack of the intellectual 
community uniting masters of form, technical masters and students.<br>3. The lack of a general leading idea.<br>4. The inclusion of purely personal views ('comme I'ampur sans fil...') in the creative process.<br>5.
 The development of metaphysical problems and speculations of a 
political, religious or other nature, instead of common efforts directed
 at realistic problems pertaining to creative work, etc.<br>My friends in Weimar will attest that my criticism was always exclusively directed at these perfectly impersonal points.<br>At
 the time I expressed my stand to various people in Weimar in the 
following manner 'I would be of an entirely different opinion if the 
Bauhaus were merely another free art school where students were expected
 to experiment according to their own inclinations. I would be happy 
that such a school existed. The Bauhaus, however, presented a programme,
 it seemed to espouse a mission, so I ask, how will it reach its goal, 
and realize its programme, when it scatters its energies in Mazdaznan, 
In Ittenism and individualistic artistic production?' This was my stand 
in Weimar in 1920-23. This opinion of mine referred to the centre of 
artistic reaction, to any and all academic sleeping powders and canned 
works of art!<br>I would like to make it clear that the Bauhaus is, <em>in spite of everything, </em>of
 enormous Importance not only in the evolution of German art, but of 
universal art as well, inasmuch as it fulfils its cultural mission (that
 is: It helps the development of all creative potential).<br>Because of this significance of the Bauhaus, it will have no problems winning over the leading artists of Europe.<br>I
 am convinced that if we consider the potential of the Bauhaus without 
starting from its programme, but see it as a 'cultural phenomenon', then
 the opponents of Germany and of the Nordic point of view would be glad 
to hear of the Bauhaus's dissolution. (The German government emphasized 
the moral <em>obligation </em>of the Bauhaus.)<br>Do not believe that 
the artists of De Stijl take that stand. And do not think it of me. 
either. I ask you to recall the words of one German philosopher: 'Most 
people criticize the cause they espouse.'<br>As a pioneer of a new 
formal language I feel obliged to offer you my support in both a 
'positive' and a 'relative' aspect, in regard to the attacks against the
 Bauhaus. Greetings from your fellow worker, Theo van Doesburg<br>Inscribed
 in the right upper corner of the letter the motto: 'L'avenir vient du 
nord.' (The future approaches from the north.) - Fernand léger.<br>(Doesburg's letter Is at the Bauhaus Archiv, Berlin.)</p>
