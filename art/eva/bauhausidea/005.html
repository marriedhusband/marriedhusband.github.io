  		<h1>Chapter 1. The Beauty of Progress</h1>

  								Walter Gropius received his appointment as director in the Weimar Court
  								Chamberlain's Office. In 1969 he recalled: 'I arrived at the name 
				instinctively. I did not want to use the term <em>Bauhütte </em>which had exclusively medieval connotations. I wanted a new, paradoxical name, something more far-reaching. The German word <em>bauen </em>has a very wide-ranging meaning: among other things, one <em>builds </em>character.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn1" href="#ftn1">1</a></p>
	<p><span class="paranumber">2</span>Gropius was born 
  						on 18 May 1883 into a family coming from a long line of German 
  						Intellectuals. Both his father and his grandfather were architects, the 
  						latter a friend of the prestigious architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. 
  						His grandfather's brother, Martin Gropius, designed the Berlin Museum of
  						Applied Art, and became director of the Berlin School of Applied Art in
  						1867.</p>

  						<p><span class="paranumber">3</span>In the early 
  								years of the century Walter Gropius followed with keen interest the 
  								revolution taking place in technology and architecture, the beginnings 
  								of mass production and the rapid rationalization of its processes. While
  								quite young, he became convinced that standardization and serial 
  								production would enter the domain of architecture as well. According to 
  								his second wife, Ise Gropius, he had arrived at this conclusion as a 
  								student in 1906, when an enlightened Pomeranian landowner, one of his 
  								uncle Erich Gropius's neighbours, commissioned him to build inexpensive 
  								housing for the employees on his estate. According to Ise Gropius, 'This
  								is probably from where we may trace the germ of the idea that the 
  								construction of dwellings must be based on industrial mass production.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn2" href="#ftn2">2</a></p>

  						<p><span class="paranumber">4</span>Actually this 
  								idea had been in the air. Advances in machine production brought about a
  								new state of affairs in the manufacture of objects as well as in 
  								architecture. The challenge of the machine was taken up by creative 
  								individuals of every description, and German architects, painters, 
  								sculptors, art historians, manufacturers and educators responded in a 
  								wave of overwhelming momentum, confidence and optimism, supported by the
  								mighty resources of German society and industry. 'In retrospect it 
  								seems as if all the spiritual and artistic power of the age had been 
  								waiting to join forces, obeying one and the same impulse,' writes 
  								Braun-Feldweg.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn3" href="#ftn3">3</a> This joining of forces occurred in 1907 with the establishment of the 
  								Deutscher Werkbund. The organizers and leading figures of the 
  								association, Peter Behrens, Theodor Fischer, Hermann Muthesius, Bruno 
  								Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, Henry van de Velde and numerous others, 
  								including politicians, designated as their objective 'the ennoblement of
  								handiwork through the union of art, industry and handcraft'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn4" href="#ftn4">4</a> The Werkbund amassed the leading personages of German art and 
  								architecture, and their unified front, together with the consolidated 
  								radicalism of their innovative strivings, endowed this association with 
  								considerable significance in public life. Most important was their 
  								insistence on quality, the aspect of production most threatened by 
  								mechanization. They declared their Intention of 'selecting the best 
  								representatives of art, industry, crafts, and trades, of combining all 
  								efforts towards high quality in industrial work, and of forming a 
  								rallying-point for all those who are able and willing to work for high

  								considering it a public issue of the gravest consequence, and realizing 
  								that the majority of society was unaware of the true significance of 
  								these questions. They grasped every opportunity to further their 
  								objective, relying on the triumph of the deepest human values to 
  								overcome and tame machines, and thereby maintain the human face of the 
  								human environment. In the words of Braun-Feldweg:</p>

  								<p class="citation">Their speeches, writings and acts indicate a
  										passionate pedagogic involvement ... It is impossible to convey the 
  										breadth and intensity of the Werkbund's approach to innumerable problems
  										of modem life, to the formal appearance of objects, and how it regarded
  										these as basic Issues of national identity. Whether it is 'the street 
  										as an artistic phenomenon' (August Endell); 'the structure of vehicles' 
  										(Ernst Neumann, painter and outstanding automobile body designer); 
  										Gropius pondering the 'style-creating power of industrial structures' 
  										('These works of industry and technology must give rise to new forms'); 
  										or Peter Behrens speaking about 'the use of time and space and its 
  										effect on modem design developments' - we are constantly impressed by 
  										these men of action fully engaged in the whirl of everyday life, and 
  										their full awareness of it. All of the questions that still interest us 
  										have been raised by them in theory or practice during the years 1908-14,
  										among calmer circumstances than those prevailing in the 1920s.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn7" href="#ftn7">7</a></p>

  				<p><span class="paranumber">6</span>Given this kind of
  						intellectual-professional environment, the programme developed by the 
  						Werkbund might have led to the young Gropius's growing conviction that 
  						only the collaboration of artists of the highest calibre could assure 
  						the aesthetic quality of standardized forms designed for mass 
  						production. This is where he may have derived his unshakeable conviction
  						that human intuition must not be left out of machine-made products.</p>

  						<p><span class="paranumber">7</span>In 1907, when 
  								the Werkbund was established, Gropius was 24 years old and working at 
  								the architectural offices of Peter Behrens, who was perhaps the most 
  								highly regarded architect of the day. Thus the movement that claimed 
  								Behrens, chiefly a designer of Industrial plants, and other architects 
  								who mattered for Gropius, constituted the first - and possibly the most 
  								profound - professional and philosophical commitment in his life. In the
  								1913 <em>Werkbund Yearbook </em>he wrote: 'The invention of new, expressive forms demands a strong artistic ... personality. Only the most brilliant (<em>genialsten</em>)
  								Ideas are good enough for multiplication by industry and worthy of 
  								benefiting not just the individual but the public as a whole.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn8" href="#ftn8">8</a></p>

  						<p><span class="paranumber">8</span>However, this 
  								notion was not able to bridge the extensive theoretical and practical 
  								uncertainties it glossed over. The involvement of the artist in machine 
  								production was not going to be so idyllically clear-cut; this was the 
  								very issue that would produce the first, and basic, rift in the 
  								Werkbund's unity. At the 1914 Werkbund Congress in Cologne it was 
  								obvious that there were two camps facing each other. One of these shared
  								Mutheslus's views: 'Architecture and the entire sphere of activity of 
  								the Werkbund tend towards standardization. It is only by standardization
  								that they can recover that universal importance which they possessed in
  								ages of harmonious civilization. Only by standardization ... as a 
  								salutary concentration of forces can a generally accepted and reliable 
  								taste be introduced.' Meanwhile Henry van de Velde, representing the 
  								opposition, passionately declaimed: 'As long as there are artists in the
  								Werkbund ... they will protest against any proposed canon and 
  								standardization. The artist is essentially and intimately a passionate 
  								individualist, a spontaneous creator. Never will he, of his own free 
  								will, submit to a discipline forcing upon him a norm, a canon.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn9" href="#ftn9">9</a> Gropius's fellow architect, Endell, and some 25-30 other Werkbund members whom Gropius refers to as the 'opposition',<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn10" href="#ftn10">10</a> were ready to sharpen the conflict: either Muthesius should resign, or 
  								else they would. They resented the relegation of the artist's role to 
  								the background, and even 'the use of the soulless term &quot;standardization&quot;
  								created the most violent opposition. This intimidating word, with its 
  								Greek root and Franco-German ending (<em>Typisierung). </em>does not really enlighten us about how and when it ought to be used.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn11" href="#ftn11">11</a></p>
				</div>
  				<p><span class="paranumber">9</span>The Werkbund 
  						debate was the clash of the same forces that collided in subsequent 
  						conflicts at the Bauhaus: the polarization of artistic individuality 
  						versus the increasing depersonalization of mass production became 
  						defined as one of the fundamental conflicts of the age. In prophetically
  						summarizing the essentials of the debate, August Endell was actually 
  						forecasting an outline of the eventual developments at the Bauhaus. In 
  						conclusion to the 1914 debate he wrote:</p>
  				<blockquote>

  								<ul style="top: 0px;" class="sidenotes1">
  										<li><span class="num">12</span> Ibid., p. 274.</li>
								</ul>
  								<p class="citation">The Werkbund is faced with an important 
  										decision to choose its aim: quality and standardization, or the serious 
  										involvement of beauty and the artist as equal partners in industry. The 
  										Werkbund will have a viable future only if it decides in favour of the 
  										latter. If it chooses the murky and ambiguous terms <em>quality </em>and <em>standardization, </em>the
  										Werkbund will expose itself to the danger of sinking to the level of a 
  										mere organ of the ethical-cultural advertising so popular these days. 
  										Not even those manufacturers with business reasons for the artist's 
  										collaboration would agree to this, for they see that, although the 
  										artist is barely tolerated in the Werkbund, he is most suitably 
  										qualified for advertisements of that sort.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn12" href="#ftn12">12</a></p>

  						<p><span class="paranumber">10</span>As we shall 
  								see, many of Gropius's later decisions, seemingly completely irrational 
  								at the time, originated from this position statement of the Werkbund 
  								leadership: never, under any circumstances, would they grant absolute 
  								priority to the machine, or recognize it as an end in itself. This 
  								viewpoint was all the more heroic in that all practical considerations, 
  								as well as the rationalism so inseparable from machine production, point
  								in the opposite direction. In 1914, on the eve of the war, the 
  								Intellectual leaders of the Werkbund demonstrated that even though they -
  								being competent technicians - were fully aware of the positive aspects 
  								and natural history of mechanical production, they held it most 
  								important for the future that the human factor should not be relegated 
  								to the background. It was a basic issue of survival affecting all of 
  								human culture that technology should In no way pose a threat to the 
  								freedom of human inventiveness and imagination. The situation was 
  								already approaching a crisis; in the words of Theodor Fischer: 'Industry
  								has lost sight of its aim of producing work of the highest quality and 
  								does not feel Itself to be a serving member of our community but the

						</ul>
  						<p><span class="paranumber">12</span>By virtue of 
  								his personality and aptitudes, his social and public position, Gropius 
  								seemed predestined for a leading role. He was resolute, clear-sighted in
  								pinpointing problems and resilient in debate, had an excellent 
  								intuitive grasp of a situation, and displayed a fundamentally farsighted
  								optimism and extraordinary organizing ability. He was able to remain 
  								detached from every conflict, and maintained a coolly correct attitude 
  								even in situations that involved him personally. (Perhaps this is why 
  								Klee later called him 'The Silver Prince'.) He needed a base of 
  								operations under his autonomous direction. This is also how he was 
  								perceived by Henry van de Velde, director of the Weimar Grand Ducal 
  								School of Arts and Crafts, who, as a Belgian citizen, had to resign 
  								after the war broke out. In 1915 he recommended Gropius, along with 
  								Hermann Obrist and August Endell, as his successor. The ruler of Weimar,
  								the Grand Duke of Saxony, had been urging since 1913 that the otherwise
  								unexceptionable van de Velde be replaced by a German director working 
  								'in the spirit of the new nationalism', someone who would follow the 
  								more desirable neo-Biedermeier and neo-classicist trends which were 
  								deemed more autochthonously German than the cosmopolitan Sezession 
  								style.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn15" href="#ftn15">15</a> Van de
  								Velde, who had no knowledge of the Grand Duke's personal tastes, was 
  								mainly motivated by Gropius's innate qualifications for leadership 
  								(although he must have been familiar with the Fagus Shoe Factory, and 
  								the factory building designed for the 1914 Cologne Werkbund Exhibition),
  								as can be seen from the question he asked in his letter informing 
  								Gropius about his nomination: 'Where and in what periodicals can I find 
  								publications of your works?'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn16" href="#ftn16">16</a></p>
				</div>
  				<p><span class="paranumber">13</span>Gropius 
  						recognized the extraordinary opportunity presented by van de Velde's 
  						offer. He immediately travelled to Weimar, where the Grand Duke received
  						him, but negotiations had to be suspended because of the war. Gropius 
  						was called up for active service, and the building of the School of Arts
  						and Crafts was converted into a military hospital.</p>

  								from the battlefield in 1916 he sent a memorandum entitled 'Proposals 
  								for the Establishment of an Institute Offering Artistic Direction to 
  								Industry, Applied Art and Crafts' to the Grand Ducal Ministry of State.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn17" href="#ftn17">17</a> In this writing he outlined the ideas he had developed in response to 
  								the prewar Werkbund debates: his proposal was aimed at the ways and 
  								means of reconciling the mutually conflicting interests of large-scale 
  								industry and commerce on the one hand, and artistic and craft activity 
  								on the other. He conceived of a new kind of institution, a coordinating 
  								way-station of sorts, which would ensure that the articles to be 
  								manufactured combined the advantages of mass production with a high 
  								level of aesthetic value, by providing a common ground where the 
  								quantitative criteria of technological production could encounter that 
  								elusive qualitative extra that we like to call the artist's personality.</p>

						</ul>
  						<p><span class="paranumber">15</span>Although this 
  								text was composed in its entirety on the battlefield, Groplus failed to 
  								take into account the fact of the war itself; he assumed an industry of 
  								undiminished power, a balanced society and unabated technological 
  								progress. Meanwhile it was precisely the upheaval caused by the war that
  								occasioned the passage of these 'Proposals' into the Grand Duke's 
  								hands. This was an age racked by the fever pitch of technological 
  								revolution, the fervour of 'Americanization', while marking time, 
  								vegetating, in the throes of the war in a state of heightened 
  								malleability. The age was receptive to considering any innovative 
  								system. As a matter of fact, given the Irrationality of the war, almost 
  								any concept, no matter how fantastic, would have received a serious 
  								hearing; Gropius's ideas had the advantage of being quite sensible. 'The
  								old-fashioned craftsman combined in his person the technician, the 
  								merchant and the artist. If we now omit the artist from this triad, then
  								the machine-made product will be nothing but an inferior substitute of 
  								the handcrafted item. But commercial circles are well aware of the 
  								surplus value contributed to industry by the artist's spiritual labour.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn18" href="#ftn18">18</a> In reformulating the position taken by Ended and the other Werkbund 
  								leaders, Gropius was demonstrating that he was, in the strictest sense, a
  								more level-headed and circumspect successor to van de Velde. The 
  								participation of the artist in production was seen as the ultimate 
  								guarantee of the product's quality. 'Today all of industry must take 
  								seriously the task of considering artistic values. The manufacturer has 
  								to be careful to avoid the stigma of his products appearing to be mere 
  								substitutes, and should endow them with the noble aspects of handcrafted
  								goods, while keeping the advantages of machine production … Only the 
  								artist is capable of breathing a soul into the inert machine-made 
  								object; it is the artist's creative power that survives in the object as
  								live leavening.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn19" href="#ftn19">19</a> This viewpoint, held by the Werkbund and Gropius, evinced a classical 
  								sense of ethics that would be within Gropius's lifetime mercilessly 
  								invalidated by economic considerations, so that the humanistic restraint
  								of technological progress, the limitation of profits ort account of 
  								human factors, would remain a Utopia, the purest Utopia of the Bauhaus. 
  								That which Gropius labelled the 'stigma of ersatz substitutes' would, 
  								not much later, reappear billed as triumphant innovations, splendid 
  								cost-diminishing or profit-increasing factors, while quality as an 
  								ethical concept was laid to rest once and for all.</p>
				</div>
  				<p><span class="paranumber">16</span>Gropius and his 
  						like-minded fellow members of the Werkbund carried on and even enhanced 
  						the Sezessionist longing for a new style that would apply to all of 
  						material culture, and that would characterize a whole period. Gropius 
  						and his colleagues considered industrial production itself to be a 
  						potential cultural outlet, and strove to bring about the manufacture of 
  						products that were repositories of aesthetic content, to the point where
  						even a ventilator, a cooking utensil or an automobile would represent 
  						German culture to the extent that a painting or a poem does.</p>

  								<li><span class="num">20</span> Ibid.</li>
						</ul>
  						<p><span class="paranumber">17</span>At the same 
  								time in his 'Proposals' Gropius also indicated that he intended to pay 
  								attention to the requirements of industry. He wrote, for instance, that 
  								the greatest care must be taken in selecting the applicants for 
  								admission to the new institute 'so that tangible results may be shown as
  								soon as possible'.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn20" href="#ftn20">20</a> In spite of the fact that he was talking about a school which, because 
  								of Its very nature, must make long-term plans, he made sure to refer to 
  								the basic expectation of the investors: I.e., the speediest return for 
  								their investment. This ambivalence of professional, pedagogic and 
  								economic values would haunt the Bauhaus for the duration of its 
  								existence.</p>
				</div>
  				<p><span class="paranumber">18</span>Although it is 
  						most difficult, If not impossible, to separate the external/historical 
  						from the interior/subjective human factors and the roles that they 
  						played in the fate of the Bauhaus, the history of this institution 
  						suggests that the dream of a humanistic technological culture received 
  						its death blow from both directions. External factors - the ongoing 
  						political strife - never allowed the Bauhaus a moment of respite to 
  						become a freely creative educational institution unfettered by budgetary
  						worries, with the luxury of the right to commit an occasional mistake. 
  						Such independence remained a dream to the end; even the prospect of 
  						purchasing it at a financial cost glimmered on the horizon only at rare 
  						moments. Whereas on the subjective side, the involvement of the artist 
  						in the humanization of technology was hindered by the rudimentary, 
  						immature state of theory and practice, and the vacuum existing between 
  						the personal artistic make-up of the Bauhaus masters and the designated 
  						common goal.</p>

						</ul>
  						<p><span class="paranumber">19</span>Gropius himself
  								saw the future unequivocally in terms of the gains to be made in the 
  								design and manufacture of standardized mass-produced items. His prewar 
  								writings all point in this direction. A glance at the titles is enough: A <em>Travelling Exhibition of Modern Factory Architecture </em>(1911), <em>Monumental Art and Industrial Architecture </em>(1911), Are <em>Aesthetic Criteria Reconcilable with Practical and Commercial Viewpoints in the Construction of Industrial Buildings? </em>(1912), <em>The Development of Modern Industrial Architecture </em>(1913), and <em>The Style-creating Power of Industrial Architectural Forms </em>(1914).
  								Throughout all of these writings he persisted in his belief that the 
  								design of factory-made products and the creative work of the 
  								individuated, independent artist can be brought to a common denominator.
  								He assumed that the artist would seek participation in such a 
  								collective enterprise. Meanwhile one has the feeling that Gropius, when 
  								he refers to the artist's involvement in production, fudges the meaning 
  								of the word to denote what already at the turn of century was designated
  								by the term designer - <em>Gestalter. </em>For he would have the artist
  								involved In the process of mechanized production just as it was, broken
  								Into several phases, whereas the work of the artist Is Indivisible and 
  								constitutes an undivided whole. Elsewhere, in his more Utopian writings,
  								he outlines a state of affairs, existing in a post-mutation society, 
  								where the meaning of the word <em>artist </em>would be clarified only in the context of the future,<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn21" href="#ftn21">21</a> at a time when the newfangled methods of production would have become 
  								universal, and the newfangled artist-mutant would be just another link 
  								in the process.</p>

  						<p><span class="paranumber">20</span>When he says <em>artist, </em>Gropius
  								never intends the commonly accepted usage as painter, sculptor or 
  								graphic artist, but rather some undefined future descendant of these, as
  								if (and here he is close to László Moholy-Nagy's reasoning of a few 
  								years later)<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn22" href="#ftn22">22</a> the arts of painting, sculpture and graphics were superannuated 
  								activities relegated to the past by machine-produced articles. The only 
  								part of the artist he would retain is that certain elixir of personal 
  								uniqueness and intuition. When he writes, 'The new, enthusiastic, formal
  								expression requires intensive artistic powers, artistic personality',<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn23" href="#ftn23">23</a> he is obviously thinking of designers: 'Automobile and railroad car, 
  								steamship and sailboat, dirigible and airplane ... in their pure forms 
  								clearly discernible at a glance both conceal and sum up the complexity 
  								of their technical organization. In them, technological and artistic 
  								form have matured into an organic whole.'<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn24" href="#ftn24">24</a> For Gropius, the arts essentially meant this new aesthetic, and most 
  								likely the Werkbund's use of the term was very similar. It is unlikely 
  								that when van de Velde resisted so emotionally the exclusion of the 
  								artist from industrial design, he had Intended to clear the way for Klee
  								or Kandinsky's autonomous, metaphysical art - towards the design of 
  								electric tea kettles.</p>
				</div>
  				<p><span class="paranumber">21</span>The elemental - 
  						and, we may as well say, historical - differences between the spheres of
  						technological and autonomous art can be best seen precisely in those 
  						Instances that promised a realization of their synthesis. In the years 
  						following the October revolution, Wassily Kandinsky, Kasimir Malevich, 
  						Gustav Klucis and other abstract, Suprematist artists provided 
  						decorative motifs for the products of a Petersburg porcelain factory, 
  						chiefly teacups and saucers. These objects are valuable documents of an 
  						era, and vividly testify to their creators' willingness to participate 
  						in the aesthetic transformation of everyday objects, in the creation, 
  						according to their lights, of a new aesthetic value for the new man. 
  						Meanwhile, with the exception of a few architectonic vessels by 
  						Malevich, their decorative motifs float as alien elements, like decals 
  						of painterly compositions on the traditional tableware. Had Gropius 
  						commissioned these artists to participate in the work of the porcelain 
  						factory, no doubt he would have had them design new forms out of new 
  						materials to fulfil new functions, but it is by no means certain that 
  						the artists would have accepted a task requiring technical know-how 
  						beyond their command.</p>

						</ul>
  						<p><span class="paranumber">22</span>At the same 
  								time Gropius never even entertained the thought that there could still 
  								be artists unaffected by technological progress. He firmly believed 
  								there was no higher artistic task, no work more exalted, timely or 
  								appropriate for the artist, than bringing aesthetic quality to mass 
  								production, a blessing for everyone. This would mean Americanism 
  								domesticated and tamed, transfused with a new soul, filtered through the
  								sieve of European culture. In his photo collection at the time Gropius 
  								cherished an image of American wheat silos, contructed along perfectly 
  								functionalist lines.<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn25" href="#ftn25">25</a> This was progress indeed: architectural design of a high qualify, 
  								perfectly rational, free of 'artistic' frills, and therefore 
  								aesthetically appealing. Such design, moreover, stood for ethical 
  								values, since it served a functional purpose for the benefit of the 
  								community. On this avenue of progress Gropius glimpsed endless vistas of
  								prosperity for all of society.</p>
